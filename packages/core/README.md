# @hashgraph-did-sdk/core

This package forms the foundation of the Hashgraph DID SDK. It provides essential interfaces, utilities, and validation tools for working with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on the Hedera network.

## Features

- **Interfaces:** Exports core interfaces for DID operations and Hedera interactions.
- **Key Management:** Provides utilities for handling and transforming cryptographic keys in various formats.
- **DID Validation:** Ensures DIDs comply with the specification using the `isHederaDID` function.
- **TypeScript Support:** Built with TypeScript to enhance developer experience and code maintainability.

## Installation
