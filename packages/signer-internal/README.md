# @hashgraph-did-sdk/signer-internal

This package provides the `Signer` class, a core component of the Hashgraph DID SDK. It enables secure key management and digital signature generation for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using the ED25519 algorithm. The `Signer` class adheres to the `Signer` interface, providing a standardized way to handle cryptographic operations within the Hedera DID ecosystem.

## Features

- **Key Management:** Generate ED25519 key pairs or initialize from existing keys, providing flexibility in key management workflows.
- **Signing and Verification:** Efficiently sign messages and verify signatures, ensuring data integrity and authenticity within your DID implementations.
- **Compatibility:** Supports both raw and DER-formatted keys for seamless integration with different systems and libraries.
- **Security:** Designed with security best practices to safeguard your private keys and ensure the reliability of signature operations.
- **Hedera Network Support:** Supports DID creation on the Hedera mainnet and testnet.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @hashgraph-did-sdk/signer-internal
```

## Usage

Learn how to use the `Signer` class to generate key pairs, sign messages, and verify signatures in the [Signer Guide](https://swiss-digital-assets-institute.github.io/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/documentation/0.0.2-alpha/04-implementation/components/signer-guide.html).

## API Reference
