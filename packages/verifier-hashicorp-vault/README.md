# @hashgraph-did-sdk/verifier-hashicorp-vault

This package provides a way to create a `Verifier` class that allows HashiCorp Vault to be used for secure key management and digital signature verification for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using the ED25519 algorithm.

## Features

- **Key Management:** Use Ed25519 keys stored in HashiCorp Vault for flexible key handling.
- **Verification:** Verify DID operations securely using Vault-managed Ed25519 keys.
- **Authentication:** Supports authentication via Vault tokens, user/password, and AppRole for secure access.
- **Security:** Keeps private keys inside Vault, ensuring strong protection and controlled access.
- **Vault Integration:** Seamlessly interacts with HashiCorp Vault for key storage, retrieval, and verification operations.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @hashgraph-did-sdk/verifier-hashicorp-vault
```

## Usage

Learn how to use the `Verifier` and `VaultVerifierFactory` class to sign messages, and verify signatures in the [Vault Verifier Guide](https://swiss-digital-assets-institute.github.io/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/documentation/0.0.2-alpha/04-implementation/components/hashicorp-vault-verifier-guide.html).
