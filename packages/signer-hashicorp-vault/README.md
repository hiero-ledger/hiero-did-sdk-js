# @hashgraph-did-sdk/signer-hashicorp-vault

This package provides a way to create a `Signer` class that allows HashiCorp Vault to be used for secure key management and digital signature generation for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using the ED25519 algorithm.

## Features

- **Key Management:** Create new Ed25519 keys or use existing ones stored in HashiCorp Vault for flexible key handling.
- **Signing and Verification:** Sign DID operations securely using Vault-managed Ed25519 keys.
- **Authentication:** Supports authentication via Vault tokens, user/password, and AppRole for secure access.
- **Security:** Keeps private keys inside Vault, ensuring strong protection and controlled access.
- **Vault Integration:** Seamlessly interacts with HashiCorp Vault for key storage, retrieval, and signing operations.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @hashgraph-did-sdk/signer-hashicorp-vault
```
