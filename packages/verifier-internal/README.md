# @hashgraph-did-sdk/verifier-internal

This package provides the `Verifier` class, a core component of the Hashgraph DID SDK. It enables digital signature verification for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using the ED25519 algorithm. The `Verifier` class adheres to the `Verifier` interface, providing a standardized way to handle cryptographic operations within the Hedera DID ecosystem.

## Features

- **Verification:** Efficiently verify signatures, ensuring data integrity and authenticity within your DID implementations.
- **Compatibility:** Supports both raw and multibase-formatted keys for seamless integration with different systems and libraries.
- **Security:** Designed with security best practices to safeguard your private keys and ensure the reliability of signature operations.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @hashgraph-did-sdk/verifier-internal
```

## Usage

Learn how to use the `Verifier` class to verify signatures in the [Verifier Guide](https://swiss-digital-assets-institute.github.io/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/documentation/0.0.2-alpha/04-implementation/components/verifier-guide.html).

## API Reference
