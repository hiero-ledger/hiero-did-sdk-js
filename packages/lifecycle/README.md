# @hashgraph-did-sdk/lifecycle

This package provides a lifecycle management system for orchestrating complex asynchronous operations within the Hashgraph DID SDK. It enables developers to define sequences of steps, handle asynchronous actions, manage signatures, and control the flow of execution with features like pausing and resuming. By streamlining these processes, it simplifies the development of robust and reliable DID-related applications.

## Features

- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Define a clear sequence of asynchronous steps for DID operations.
- **Callback Integration:** Incorporate custom callback functions at any point in the lifecycle.
- **Signature Handling:** Include signature generation and verification steps seamlessly.
- **Pause/Resume Functionality:** Introduce pauses for manual intervention or external interactions, and resume execution when ready.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling with catch steps to gracefully handle exceptions.
- **Flexible Builder Pattern:** Provides a fluent API for building and configuring lifecycles with ease.
- **TypeScript Support:** Built with TypeScript for enhanced developer experience and type safety.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @hashgraph-did-sdk/lifecycle
```
