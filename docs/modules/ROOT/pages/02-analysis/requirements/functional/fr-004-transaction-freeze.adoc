=== FR 004: Transaction And Operation Should Be Able To Be Frozen

==== Description

Any operation or transaction performed using the SDK should be able to be frozen. Freezing a transaction or operation involves blocking the possibility of further editing, thus putting it in a state ready to be signed and executed. In this way, we will be able to avoid consistency problems.

==== Status

Draft

==== Acceptance Criteria

* The SDK should provide a method to freeze a transaction or operation.
* The SDK should provide a method to check if a transaction or operation is frozen.
* The frozen state of a transaction or operation should be immutable.
* The frozen state of a transaction or operation should be irreversible.
* The frozen transaction or operation should be ready to be signed and executed.
