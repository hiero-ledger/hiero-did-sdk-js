=== FR 014: Dereference DID Document Fragment

==== Description

The SDK should provide an option to dereference a DID Document fragment. Dereferencing a fragment means resolving the fragment of a DID Document and not just the whole document. Fragment can be a service, verification method or any verification relationship. The resolved fragment should be fully compatible with the DID specification. Dereferencing should be supported by DID URL. Resolved fragment should be a valid service type of verification method type. 

Example of a DID URL with fragment:
```
did:hedera:testnet:z8brLDSMuByWYqd1A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihD4GmHdzar_0.0.4388790#service-1
```
or
```
did:hedera:testnet:z8brLDSMuByWYqd1A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihD4GmHdzar_0.0.4388790#key-1
```
