*Usage*

Here's an example demonstrating how to resolve a DID and retrieve its DID Document:

[source,typescript]
----
import { resolveDID } from '@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/resolver';

// Resolve a DID to retrieve its DID Document
const didDocument = await resolveDID('did:hedera:testnet:z6Mkhj...'); // Replace with the DID you want to resolve

console.log(didDocument);
