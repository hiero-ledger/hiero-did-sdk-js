The following example demonstrates how to use the `Publisher` to submit a transaction to the Hedera network:

[source,typescript]
----
import { Publisher } from '@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/publisher-internal';
import { Client } from '@hashgraph/sdk';

// Create a Hedera Client instance for the testnet
const client = Client.forTestnet(); 

// Configure the client with your network and account details
// ...

// Instantiate a new Publisher with the configured client
const publisher = new Publisher(client);

// Publish a transaction to the Hedera network
const transactionReceipt = await publisher.publish(transaction);
