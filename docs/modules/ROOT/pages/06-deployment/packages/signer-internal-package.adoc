== Signer Internal Package

This package provides an internal signer for the Hashgraph DID SDK, managing keys in memory. It's suitable for development, testing, and applications with less stringent security needs.

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
npm install @hashgraph-did-js-sdk/signer-internal
----

=== Usage

The example below demonstrates how to use the `Signer`:

[source,typescript]
----
import { Signer } from '@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/signer-internal'; 

// Instantiate a new Signer with an existing key (hexadecimal format)
const signer = new Signer("0x..."); 

const publicKey = await signer.getPublicKey(); 
const signature = await signer.sign(message);
const isValid = await signer.verify(message, signature);
