= Messages API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the Messages component within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Message Classes

=== DIDMessage

Represents an abstract DID Message. All other DID Message classes inherit from this class. It streamlines common functionality for DID Messages, such as signing and verifying messages.

==== Class Diagram

==== Properties

|===
| Name | Type | Description

|signature
|`Uint8Array`
|The signature of the DID Message.

|operation
|`DIDMessageOperation`
|The operation of the DID Message, such as "create", "update", or "revoke".

|did
|`string`
|The DID string of the Decentralized Identifier.

|message
|`object`
|The message object. It varies depending on the operation and message type. Includes the encoded event and other message-specific data.

|topicId
|`string`
|The ID of the Hedera topic associated with the DID.

|messageBytes
|`Uint8Array`
|The byte array of the message. It is used for signing and verifying the message.

|payload
|`string`
|The actual content of the message that is published to the Hedera topic. It contains the message and the signature in a base64-encoded string. It may throw an error if the message is not signed.
|===

==== Methods

===== *`signWith`*
[source,typescript]
----
signWith(signer: Signer): Promise<void>
----

Signs the DID Message with the provided signer.

Parameters::
* `signer`: The signer object used to sign the DID Message.


===== *`setSignature`*
[source,typescript]
----
setSignature(
  signature: Uint8Array,
  verifier: Verifier,
): Promise<void>
----

Sets the signature of the DID Message and verifies the signature with the provided verifier.

Parameters::
* `signature`: The signature to set.
* `verifier`: The verifier object used to verify the signature.

Errors::
The following exceptions may arise during the execution of the `setSignature` function:

|===
|Exception code
|Description

|`invalidSignature`
|The signature is invalid.
|===


===== *`toBytes`*
[source,typescript]
----
abstract toBytes(): string
----

Serializes the DID Message into a byte array in base64 format.

Returns::
The serialized DID Message as a base64-encoded string.

===== *`fromBytes`*
[source,typescript]
----
static abstract fromBytes(bytes: string): DIDMessage
----

Deserializes a DID Message from a byte array in base64 format.

Parameters::
* `bytes`: The byte array containing the serialized DID Message.

Returns::
The deserialized DID Message object.



=== DIDOwnerMessage

Represents a DID Owner message, used for creating and managing DID ownership.

This class encapsulate the `DIDOwner` event payload from Hedera Hashgraph DID Method Specification.

==== Class Diagram

==== Properties

[cols="1,1,3", options="header", frame="ends"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description
| publicKey | `PublicKey` | The public key of the DID owner, in the form of a PublicKey object.
| timestamp | `Date` | The timestamp of the DID Owner message creation.
| network | `Network` | The network on which the DID Owner message is created.
| controller | `string` | The DID that controls the DID owner.
|===

==== Methods

===== *`setTopicId`*
[source,typescript]
----
setTopicId(topicId: string): void;
----

Sets the topic ID of the Hedera topic associated with the DID Owner message. It also performs the verification of the topic ID.

Parameters::
* `topicId`: The ID of the Hedera topic associated with the DID Owner message.


===== *`setController`*
[source,typescript]
----
setController(controller: string): void;
----

Sets the controller of the DID Owner message. It also performs the verification of the format of the provided DID.

Parameters::
* `controller`: The DID that controls the DID owner.


===== *`setNetwork`*
[source,typescript]
----
setNetwork(network: Network): void;
----

Sets the network on which the DID Owner message is created.

Parameters::
* `network`: The network on which the DID Owner message is created.



=== DIDAddVerificationMethodMessage

Represents a DID Add Verification Method message, used for adding verification methods or a verification relationship to a DID Document.

Verification relationships are used to associate a verification method with a specific property in the DID Document, such as "assertionMethod" or "authentication".

This class encapsulate the `VerificationMethod` and `VerificationRelationship` event payload from Hedera Hashgraph DID Method Specification.

| property | `VerificationMethodProperties` | The property to which the verification method will be added (e.g., "verificationMethod", "authentication").
| publicKeyMultibase | `string` | The multibase-encoded public key of the verification method.
| id | `string` | The identifier of the verification method (e.g., "#key-1").
| timestamp | `string` | The timestamp of the DID Add Verification Method message creation.
|===


=== DIDRemoveVerificationMethodMessage

Represents a DID Remove Verification Method message, used for removing verification methods or a verification relationship from a DID Document.

This class encapsulate the `VerificationMethod` and `VerificationRelationship` event payload from Hedera Hashgraph DID Method Specification.

==== Class Diagram

== Component Implementation

The Hashgraph DID SDK provides the DID Message classes within its `messages` package. For further details, refer to the xref:06-deployment/packages/index.adoc#advanced-packages[`@hiero-did-sdk-js/messages`] package documentation.
