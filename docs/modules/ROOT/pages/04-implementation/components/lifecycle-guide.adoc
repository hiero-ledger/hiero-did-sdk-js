= Lifecycle

The Lifecycle component is the foundation of the Hashgraph DID SDK. TIt provides a powerful and flexible system for orchestrating complex asynchronous operations related to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).

== Overview

The Lifecycle Management component simplifies the development of robust and reliable DID-related applications by streamlining the process of defining, managing, and executing sequences of asynchronous steps. It provides features such as:

*   **Step-by-Step Execution:** Define a clear sequence of asynchronous steps for DID operations.
*   **Callback Integration:** Incorporate custom callback functions at any point in the lifecycle.
*   **Signature Handling:** Include signature generation and verification steps seamlessly.
*   **Pause/Resume Functionality:** Introduce pauses for manual intervention or external interactions, and resume execution when ready.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling with catch steps to gracefully handle exceptions.
*   **Flexible Builder Pattern:** Provides a fluent API for building and configuring lifecycles with ease.

These features enable developers to create complex DID workflows while maintaining a clear and organized structure.

== Using the Lifecycle Management Component

The core of the Lifecycle Management component is the `LifecycleBuilder` class. It provides a fluent API for defining the steps involved in a DID operation. Here's a basic example of how to use the `LifecycleBuilder`:

[source,typescript]
----
import { LifecycleBuilder, LifecycleRunner } from "@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/lifecycle";

const lifecycle = new LifecycleBuilder()
  .callback(async (context) => {
    // Perform an asynchronous operation
    context.data = await fetchData();  
  })
  .signWithSigner() // Sign the data
  .callback(async (context) => {
    // Continue with the next step
    await submitData(context.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle errors gracefully
    console.error("Lifecycle error:", error);
  })
  .build();

const runner = new LifecycleRunner(lifecycle);
const state = await runner.process(message, {
  // Provide necessary context (e.g., signer, publisher)
});
----

This example demonstrates a simple lifecycle with three steps:

1.  An asynchronous callback function that fetches some data.
2.  A signing step using `signWithSigner`.
3.  Another asynchronous callback function that submits the data.

The `catch` method is used to handle any errors that occur during the lifecycle execution.

The `LifecycleRunner` class is responsible for executing the lifecycle. The `process` method starts the execution and returns a `LifecycleState` object, which contains information about the current state of the lifecycle.
