|DID Document
|`DIDDocument`
|Returned if `accept` is `application/did+json` or `application/did+json`. Contains the resolved DID Document. See a full running example for link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/resolveDID-as-json.ts[JSON] examples in the source code.

|LD DID Document
|`JsonLdDIDDocument`
|Returned if `accept` is `application/did+ld+json`. Contains the resolved DID Document in JSON-LD format. See a full running example for link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/resolveDID-as-json-ld.ts[JSON-LD] examples in the source code.

|DID Resolution Response
|`DIDResolutionResponse`
|Returned if `accept` is `application/ld+json;profile="https://w3id.org/did-resolution"`. Contains the resolved DID Document and additional metadata. See a full running link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/resolveDID-with-full-metadata.ts[example] in the source code.

|CBOR Response
|`Uint8Array`
|Returned if `accept` is `application/did+cbor`. Contains the resolved DID Document in CBOR format. See a full running link: link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/resolveDID-as-cbor.ts[example] in the source code.
