= createDID API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the `createDID` function within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Function Signature

The `createDID` function can be invoked with `providers` alone to generate a DID with default settings, or with both `providers` and `options` to customize the DID creation process.

[source,js]
----
function createDID(providers: Providers): Promise<CreateDIDResult>;
function createDID(
  options: CreateDIDOptions,
  providers: Providers
): Promise<CreateDIDResult>;
----

== Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

*   **`providers`**:  (Required) An object encapsulating configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network.
*   **`options`**: (Optional) An object enabling customization of the DID creation procedure.

=== providers Parameter

== Data Types

This section elaborates on the data types employed within the `providers` and `options` parameters.

[[providers-data-types]]
=== Providers Type

To utilize this type, at least one of the following must be defined: `client` or `publisher`. If both are provided, `publisher` takes precedence.

The table below provides a detailed description of the `Providers` type.

|Name
|Type
|Description

|clientOptions?
|`ClientOptions`
|Configuration options for instantiating a Hedera Client.

|client?
|`Client`
|An instance of a Hedera Client.

|signer?
|`Signer`
|An instance of a xref:04-implementation/components/signer-guide.adoc[Signer]. If not provided, a private key must be specified in the `options` parameter to sign the DID creation message; otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

|publisher?
|`Publisher`
|An instance of a xref:04-implementation/components/publisher-guide.adoc[Publisher] responsible for submitting the DID creation transaction to the Hedera network.
|===

[[options-data-types]]
=== CreateDIDOptions Type

The table below provides a detailed description of the `CreateDIDOptions` type.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Description

|controller?
|`string`
|A DID string representing the entity controlling the newly created DID. If not specified, the generated DID will be self-managed.

|topicId?
|`string`
|The ID of the Hedera Topic associated with the DID. If omitted, a new topic will be automatically created.

|privateKey?
|`string` \| `PrivateKey`
|A private key (in DER format) or a `PrivateKey` object used to generate a xref:04-implementation/components/signer-guide.adoc[Signer] for signing the DID creation message. If neither this parameter nor `signer` (in the `providers` parameter) is specified, a new key pair is generated and the corresponding private key is returned. 
|===

== Return Value

Upon successful execution, the function returns a Promise that resolves to a `CreateDIDResult` object.

The table below describes the structure of the `CreateDIDResult` type.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]

|Name
|Type
|Description

|did
|`string`
|The DID string of the newly created Decentralized Identifier.

|didDocument
|`DIDDocument`
|The DID Document associated with the newly created DID.

|privateKey?
|`PrivateKey`
|A `PrivateKey` object. This key is used internally to generate a xref:04-implementation/components/signer-guide.adoc[Signer] for the DID creation process. It is returned only if neither a `signer` (in the `providers` parameter) nor this `privateKey` was explicitly provided.
|===

== Errors

The following table enumerates the exceptions that may arise during the execution of the `createDID` function.

|Exception class
|Description

|`InvalidControllerError`
|Indicates that the provided `controller` DID string is invalid.

|`InvalidTopicIdError`
|Indicates that the provided `topicId` is invalid.

|`InvalidPrivateKeyError`
|Indicates that the provided `privateKey` is invalid.

|`InvalidSignerError`
|Indicates that the provided `signer` is invalid.

|`InvalidPublisherError`
|Indicates that the provided `publisher` is invalid.
