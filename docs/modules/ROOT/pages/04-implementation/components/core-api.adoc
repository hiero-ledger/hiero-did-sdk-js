=== Signer

Defines the methods for signing and verifying data using a DID's private key.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Description

|sign
|`(message: Uint8Array) => Promise<Uint8Array>`
|Asynchronously signs the provided message using the signer's private key and returns a `Promise` that resolves to the signature.

|publicKey
|`() => Promise<MultibasePublicKey>`
|Asynchronously retrieves the public key associated with the signer.

|verify
|`(message: Uint8Array, signature: Uint8Array) => Promise<boolean>`
|Asynchronously verifies the given signature against the provided message using the signer's public key, returning a `Promise` that resolves to `true` if the signature is valid, `false` otherwise.
|===

=== Publisher

Defines the methods for submitting transactions to the Hedera network.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Description

|publish
|`(transaction: any) => Promise<any>`
|Asynchronously submits the provided transaction to the network, executes it, and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a result object containing the outcome of the transaction.
|===

|An array of verification methods.

|authentication?
|`string[]` or `VerificationMethod[]`
|An optional array of verification method IDs or verification methods that can be used for authentication.

|assertionMethod?
|`string[]` or `VerificationMethod[]`
|An optional array of verification method IDs or verification methods that can be used for assertion.

|keyAgreement?
|`string[]` or `VerificationMethod[]`
|An optional array of verification method IDs or verification methods that can be used for key agreement.
