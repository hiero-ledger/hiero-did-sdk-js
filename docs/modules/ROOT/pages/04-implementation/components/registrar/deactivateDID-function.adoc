== deactivateDID Function

The `deactivateDID` function in the Hashgraph DID-SDK provides a way to deactivate existing DIDs for the Hedera DID method. This action effectively revokes the DID, making it unusable for future operations.

=== Deactivating a DID Document

To deactivate a DID, you need to provide the DID string and the client options to the `deactivateDID` function.

[source,js]
----
const clientOptions = {
  privateKey: "0x...", // Replace with your Hedera account private key
  accountId: "0.0.0....", // Replace with your Hedera account ID
  network: "testnet",
};

await deactivateDID(did, { clientOptions });
----

In this example, `deactivateDID` takes the DID to be deactivated and an object containing the `clientOptions`. This configuration object should include the necessary information to interact with the Hedera network, such as the private key, account ID, and network.
