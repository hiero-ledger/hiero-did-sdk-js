= Verifier API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the `Verifier` class within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript. This class is responsible for verifying signatures.

== Class Diagram

The class diagram below illustrates the core methods of the `Verifier` interface for interacting with cryptographic keys.

== Constructor

=== `constructor`
[source,ts]
----
constructor(publicKey: PublicKey)
----

Initializes a new `Verifier` instance.

Parameters::
* `publicKey`: (Required) A public key class instance.

== Static Methods

=== `fromMultibase`
[source,ts]
----
static fromMultibase(multibase: string): Verifier
----

Initializes a new `Verifier` instance from a multibase-encoded public key.

Returns::
The new `Verifier` instance.


=== `fromBase58`
[source,ts]
----
static fromBase58(base58: string): Verifier
----

Initializes a new `Verifier` instance from a base58-encoded public key.

Returns::
The new `Verifier` instance.


== Methods

=== `publicKey`
[source,ts]
----
publicKey(): string
----

Returns the public key associated with the `Verifier` instance in DER format.

Returns::
The public key in DER format.

=== `verify`
[source,ts]
----
verify(message: Uint8Array, signature: Uint8Array): boolean
----

Verifies the given signature against the message and public key.

Parameters::
* `message`: The message that was signed.
* `signature`: The signature to be verified.

Returns::
`true` if the signature is valid, `false` otherwise.

== Class Implementation

The Hashgraph DID SDK provides the `Verifier` class within its `verifier-internal` package. For further details, refer to the xref:06-deployment/packages/index.adoc#essential-packages[`@hiero-did-sdk-js/verifier-internal`] package documentation.
