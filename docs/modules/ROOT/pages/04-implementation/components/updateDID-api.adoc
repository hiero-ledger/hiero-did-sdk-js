= updateDID API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the `updateDID` function within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Function Signature

The `updateDID` function allows you to update an existing DID document by providing the DID and an object specifying the desired modifications.

[source,js]
----
function updateDID(
  options: UpdateDIDOptions,
  providers: Providers
): Promise<UpdateDIDResult>;
----

== Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

*   **`providers`:** (Required) An object encapsulating configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network.
*   **`options`:** (Required) An object containing the DID to update and the update operations to apply.

=== providers Parameter

The table below details the structure of the `providers` parameter.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Description

|providers
|`Providers`
|An object containing a Hedera Client, a cryptographic Signer, and a transaction Publisher (refer to <<providers-data-types>> for details).
|===

=== options Parameter

The table below details the structure of the `options` parameter.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Description

|did
|`string`
|The DID string of the Decentralized Identifier to update.

|updates
|`DIDUpdateOperation \| DIDUpdateOperation[]`
|A  `DIDUpdateOperation`  type or an array of  `DIDUpdateOperation`s (refer to <<didupdateoperation-type>> for details). Each `DIDUpdateOperation` represents a specific modification to the DID Document. If an array is provided, the operations will be executed in the order they are provided.

|privateKey?
|`string` \| PrivateKey`
|A private key (in DER format) or a `PrivateKey` object used to generate a xref:04-implementation/components/signer-guide.adoc[Signer] for signing the DID update message.

|waitForDIDVisibility?
|`boolean`
|Whether to wait for the DID to be **visible** on the network. The DID registration transaction may be confirmed before the DID is actually accessible and usable on the network. This option ensures that the function waits until the DID is fully propagated and discoverable. If set to `false`, the function will return as soon as the registration transaction is confirmed, which may be faster but could lead to errors if you immediately try to use the DID. 

Defaults to `true`.

|visibilityTimeoutMs?
|`number`
|The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for the DID to be **visible** on the network. This option is only relevant if `waitForDIDVisibility` is set to `true`. If the DID is not visible within this timeout period, the function will throw an error. Defaults to 120000 milliseconds (2 minutes).
|===

== Data Types

This section elaborates on the data types employed within the `providers` parameter.

[[providers-data-types]]
=== Providers Type

To utilize this type, at least one of the following must be defined: `client` or `publisher`. If both are provided, `publisher` takes precedence.

The table below provides a detailed description of the `Providers` type.

|Description

|clientOptions?
|`ClientOptions`
|Configuration options for instantiating a Hedera Client. See a full running link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/updateDID-with-client-options.ts[example] in the source code.

|client?
|`Client`
|An instance of a Hedera Client. See a full running link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/updateDID-with-a-client.ts[example] in the source code.

|signer?
|`Signer`
|An instance of a xref:04-implementation/components/signer-guide.adoc[Signer]. If not provided, a private key must be specified in the `options` parameter to sign the DID creation message; otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

|publisher?
|`Publisher`
|An instance of a xref:04-implementation/components/publisher-guide.adoc[Publisher] responsible for submitting the DID creation transaction to the Hedera network.

[[didupdateoperation-type]]
=== DIDUpdateOperation Type

This type represents the different operations you can perform to update a DID Document. Each operation modifies the DID Document in a specific way, such as adding a verification method, removing a service, etc.

==== AddVerificationMethodOperation Type

Adds a new verification method to the DID Document.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Description

|operation
|`'add-verification-method'`
|A constant string representing the operation type.

|id
|`string`
|A unique identifier for the verification method. Must start with `#` and be unique within the DID Document, e.g., `#key-1`.

|property
|`VerificationMethodProperties`
|A string representing the verification method or relationship property to add. Possible values are:  `verificationMethod`, `authentication`, `assertionMethod`, `keyAgreement`, `capabilityInvocation`, `capabilityDelegation`.

|controller?
|`string`
|The DID that controls the verification method. If not provided, the DID of the DID Document is used.

|publicKeyMultibase?
|`string`
|The public key in multibase format to add. Optional when adding verification relationship as an alias to an existing verification method. In that case `id` must be the same as the existing verification method. Otherwise is required. See a full running link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/updateDID-with-a-private-key.ts[example] in the source code.
