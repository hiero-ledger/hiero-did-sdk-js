= submitUpdateDIDRequest API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the `submitUpdateDIDRequest` function within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Function Signature

This function resume the update flow of a Decentralized Identifier (DID) and publish update on the Hedera network using the xref:04-implementation/guides/key-management-modes-guide.adoc#client-managed-secret-mode[Client Managed Secret Mode].

The `submitUpdateDIDRequest` function is invoked with `options` and `providers`.` The `providers` parameter encapsulates configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network, while the `options` parameter takes current state of the DID update process and the signature of the signing request.


[source,js]
----
function submitUpdateDIDRequest(
  options: SubmitUpdateDIDRequestOptions,
  providers: PublisherProviders,
): Promise<UpdateDIDResult>;
----

== Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

*   **`providers`**:  (Required) An object encapsulating configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network.
*   **`options`**: (Required) An object specifying configuration options for the DID update request along with the current state of the DID update process and the signature of the signing request.

== Data Types

This section elaborates on the data types employed within the `providers` and `options` parameters.

[[providers-data-types]]
=== PublisherProviders Type

To utilize this type, at least one of the following must be defined: `client` or `publisher`. If both are provided, `publisher` takes precedence.

The table below provides a detailed description of the `PublisherProviders` type.

|clientOptions?
|`ClientOptions`
|Configuration options for instantiating a Hedera Client. See a full running link:https://github.com/DSRCorporation/hiero-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/createDID-with-client-options.ts[example] in the source code.

|client?
|`Client`
|An instance of a Hedera Client. See a full running link:https://github.com/DSRCorporation/hiero-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/createDID-with-a-client.ts[example] in the source code.

|publisher?
|`Publisher`
|An instance of a xref:04-implementation/components/publisher-guide.adoc[Publisher] responsible for submitting the DID creation transaction to the Hedera network.

[[options-data-types]]
=== SubmitUpdateDIDRequestOptions Type

The table below provides a detailed description of the `SubmitUpdateDIDRequestOptions` type.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]

|Name
|Type
|Description

|states
|`RunnerState<DIDMessage>[]`
|The `state` parameter is an array of RunnerState objects that encapsulate the current state of the DID update process. Each RunnerState represents a single operation in the DID update process. This parameter is generated by the xref:04-implementation/components/generateUpdateDIDRequest-api.adoc[`generateUpdateDIDRequest`] function. Note that the RunnerState objects must be in the correct order and must be generated sequentially.

|signatures
|`Record<string, Uint8Array>`
|The `signatures` parameter is an object containing the signatures of the signing requests. The keys of the object are unique identifiers for each RunnerState object, and the values are Uint8Array objects containing the signatures. The signatures must be generated using the private key associated with the DID root key. The signing request is generated by the xref:04-implementation/components/generateUpdateDIDRequest-api.adoc[`generateUpdateDIDRequest`] function.

|waitForDIDVisibility?
|`boolean`
|Whether to wait for the DID to be **visible** on the network. The DID registration transaction may be confirmed before the DID is actually accessible and usable on the network. This option ensures that the function waits until the DID is fully propagated and discoverable. If set to `false`, the function will return as soon as the registration transaction is confirmed, which may be faster but could lead to errors if you immediately try to use the DID.

Defaults to `true`.

|visibilityTimeoutMs?
|`number`
|The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for the DID to be **visible** on the network. This option is only relevant if `waitForDIDVisibility` is set to `true`. If the DID is not visible within this timeout period, the function will throw an error. Defaults to 120000 milliseconds (2 minutes).

|topicReader?
|`TopicReader`
|An instance of a xref:04-implementation/components/topic-reader-api.adoc[TopicReader] responsible for reading messages from the Hedera network topic.
