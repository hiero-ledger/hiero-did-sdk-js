= Lifecycle API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the Lifecycle Management component within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Classes

=== LifecycleBuilder

The `LifecycleBuilder` class provides a fluent interface for defining the steps involved in a DID operation.

==== Class Diagram

image::lifecycle-builder-class-diagram.png[]

==== Properties

===== *`length`*
[source,typescript]
----
public length: number
----

Gets the number of steps in the lifecycle.

===== *`catchStep`*
[source,typescript]
----
public catchStep?: CatchStep
----

Gets the catch step in the lifecycle that handles errors. `undefined` if no catch step is defined.

==== Methods

===== [big]*`callback`*
[source,typescript]
----
callback(label: string, callback: (message: Message, publisher: Publisher) => Promise<void> | void): LifecycleBuilder
----

Adds a callback step to the lifecycle.

Parameters::
* `label`: A unique identifier for the callback step.
* `callback`:  A function that will be executed asynchronously. It receives a `Message` object and a `Publisher` object as parameters, which provides access to data and utilities within the lifecycle.

Returns::
The `LifecycleBuilder` instance for method chaining.


===== [big]*`signature`*
[source,typescript]
----
signature(label: string): LifecycleBuilder
----

Adds a signature step to the lifecycle. This step is used to add signature to the message using the provided `signature` as an option in lifecycle runner.

Parameters::
* `label`: A unique identifier for the signature step.

Returns::
The `LifecycleBuilder` instance for method chaining.


===== [big]*`signWithSigner`*
[source,typescript]
----
signWithSigner(label: string): LifecycleBuilder
----

Adds a signing step with a `Signer` class to the lifecycle. This step uses the `Signer` provided in the lifecycle runner to sign the data.

Parameters::
* `label`: A unique identifier for the sign with signer step.

Returns::
The `LifecycleBuilder` instance for method chaining.

===== [big]*`pause`*
[source,typescript]
----
pause(label: string): LifecycleBuilder
----

Adds a pause step to the lifecycle. This allows for manual intervention or waiting for external events before continuing the execution.

Parameters::
* `label`: A unique identifier for the pause step.

Returns::
The `LifecycleBuilder` instance for method chaining.

===== [big]*`catch`*
[source,typescript]
----
catch(label: string, callback: (error: unknown) => void | Promise<void>): LifecycleBuilder
----

Adds a catch step to the lifecycle. This step is used to handle errors that occur during the execution of previous steps.

Parameters::
* `label`: A unique identifier for the catch step.
* `callback`: A function that will be executed if an error occurs. It receives the error object as a parameter.

Returns::
The `LifecycleBuilder` instance for method chaining.

===== [big]*`getByIndex`*
[source,typescript]
----
getByIndex(stepIndex: number): Steps<Message>
----

Gets the step at the specified index in the lifecycle.

Parameters::
* `stepIndex`: A number representing the index of the step to retrieve.

Returns::
A `Steps<Message>` object representing the step at the specified index.

Errors::
The following exceptions may arise during the execution of the `getByIndex` function:

[cols="1,1",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Exception code
|Description

|`internalError`
|Step index out of bounds.
|===

===== [big]*`getByLabel`*
[source,typescript]
----
getByLabel(stepLabel: string): Steps<Message>
----

Gets the step with the specified label in the lifecycle.

Parameters::
* `stepLabel`: A string representing the label of the step to retrieve.

Returns::
A `Steps<Message>` object representing the step with the specified label.

Errors::
The following exceptions may arise during the execution of the `getByLabel` function:

[cols="1,1",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Exception code
|Description

|`internalError`
|Step with label # does not exist.
|===

===== [big]*`getIndexByLabel`*
[source,typescript]
----
getIndexByLabel(stepLabel: string): number
----

Gets the index of the step with the specified label in the lifecycle.

Parameters::
* `stepLabel`: A string representing the label of the step to retrieve.

Returns::
A number representing the index of the step with the specified label.

Errors::
The following exceptions may arise during the execution of the `getByLabel` function:

[cols="1,1",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Exception code
|Description

|`internalError`
|Step with label # does not exist.
|===

=== LifecycleRunner

The `LifecycleRunner` class is responsible for executing a `Lifecycle`.

==== Class Diagram

image::lifecycle-runner-class-diagram.png[]

==== Methods

===== `constructor`
[source,typescript]
----
constructor(builder: LifecycleBuilder<Message>): LifecycleRunner
----

Initializes a new `LifecycleRunner` instance.

Parameters::
* `builder`:  A `LifecycleBuilder` object representing the lifecycle steps.

Returns::
A new `LifecycleRunner` instance.

===== `process`
[source,typescript]
----
process(
  message: Message,
  options: LifecycleRunnerOptions,
): Promise<RunnerState<Message>>
----

Starts the execution of the lifecycle.

Parameters::
* `message`:  The initial message to be processed by the lifecycle.
* `options`:  A `LifecycleRunnerOptions` object providing additional options for the lifecycle runner, like the `Publisher` and `Signer` instances.

Returns::
A `Promise` that resolves to a `LifecycleState` object, which contains information about the current state of the lifecycle and processed message.

Errors::
The following exceptions may arise during the execution of the `process` function:

[cols="1,1",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Exception code
|Description

|`invalidArgument`
|Signature and verifier are required for the signature step.

|`invalidArgument`
|Signer is missing, but required.
|===

===== `resume`
[source,typescript]
----
resume(
  state: RunnerState<Message>,
  options: LifecycleRunnerOptions,
): Promise<RunnerState<Message>>
----

Resumes the execution of a paused lifecycle.

Parameters::
* `state`: The `RunnerState` object representing the paused state of the lifecycle.
* `context`: A `LifecycleRunnerOptions` object providing additional options for the lifecycle runner, like the `Publisher` and `Signer` instances.

Returns::
A `Promise` that resolves to a `RunnerState` object, which contains information about the current state of the lifecycle.

Errors::
The following exceptions may arise during the execution of the `resume` function:

[cols="1,1",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Exception code
|Description

|`invalidArgument`
|Signature and verifier are required for the signature step.

|`invalidArgument`
|Signer is missing, but required.
|===

===== `onComplete`
[source,typescript]
----
onComplete(label: string, callback: (message: Message,) => void | Promise<void>): void
----

Registers a callback to be executed when the lifecycle step with the specified label is completed.

Parameters::
* `label`: The label of the lifecycle step.
* `callback`: A function to be executed when the step is completed.

== Component Implementation

The Hashgraph DID SDK provides the Lifecycle Management classes and interfaces within its `lifecycle` package. For further details, refer to the xref:06-deployment/packages/index.adoc#advanced-packages[`@hiero-did-sdk-js/lifecycle`] package documentation.
