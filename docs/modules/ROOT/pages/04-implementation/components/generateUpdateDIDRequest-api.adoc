= generateUpdateDIDRequest API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the `generateUpdateDIDRequest` function within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Function Signature

This function generates a request to update a Decentralized Identifier (DID) on the Hedera network using the xref:04-implementation/guides/key-management-modes-guide.adoc#client-managed-secret-mode[Client Managed Secret Mode].

The `generateUpdateDIDRequest` function is invoked with `providers` and `options` parameters. The `providers` parameter encapsulates configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network, while the `options` parameter enables customization of the DID update procedure and passing required public key.

[source,js]
----
function generateUpdateDIDRequest(
  options: GenerateUpdateDIDRequestOptions,
  providers: PublisherProviders,
): Promise<UpdateDIDRequest>;
----

== Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

*   **`providers`**:  (Required) An object encapsulating configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network.
*   **`options`**: (Required) An object containing a public key for DID root key and enabling customization of the DID update procedure.

[[didupdateoperation-type]]
=== DIDUpdateOperation Type

This type represents the different operations you can perform to update a DID Document. Each operation modifies the DID Document in a specific way, such as adding a verification method, removing a service, etc.
