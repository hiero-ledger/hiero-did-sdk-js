= Core

The core component is the foundation of the Hashgraph DID SDK. It provides essential interfaces, utilities, and validation tools for working with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on the Hedera network.

== Key Features

=== Interfaces

The core component defines several key interfaces that are used throughout the Hashgraph DID SDK:

*   `DIDDocument`: Represents a DID Document, which contains information about a DID, such as its public keys and services.
*   `Signer`:  Defines the methods for signing and verifying data using a DID's private key.
*   `Publisher`: Defines the methods for submitting transactions to the Hedera network.
*   `DIDMessage`:  Represents a message used for DID operations, such as creating, updating, or deactivating a DID.
*   `PublicKey`: An interface for representing public keys.
*   `Network`: An interface for defining Hedera network configurations.
*   `VerificationMethodProperties`: An interface for defining verification method properties.

=== Utilities

The core component also provides the `KeysUtility` class with a wide range of functions for:

*   **Transforming keys:** Convert keys between different formats (bytes, base58, multibase, Hedera `PublicKey`).
*   **Loading keys:** Load keys from various sources (bytes, base58, DER string, Hedera `PublicKey`).
*   **Exporting keys:** Export keys in different formats for use in other applications or systems.

=== DID Validation

The core component exports the `isHederaDID` function, which uses regular expressions to validate Hedera DIDs, ensuring they adhere to the DID specification:

*   Checks for correct DID format, including the `did:hedera` prefix, network, public key, and topic ID.
*   Validates the network identifier against allowed values (mainnet, testnet).
*   Uses a regular expression to validate the base58-encoded public key.


== Usage Examples

=== Validating a Hedera DID

This example demonstrates how to use the `isHederaDID` function to validate a Hedera DID:

[source, typescript]
----
import { isHederaDID } from "@hashgraph-did-sdk/core";

const did = "did:hedera:testnet:z6Mkhj..."; // Replace with the DID you want to validate

if (isHederaDID(did)) {
  console.log(`${did} is a valid Hedera DID`);
} else {
  console.log(`${did} is not a valid Hedera DID`);
}
----

=== Generating a Key Pair

This example demonstrates how to use the `KeysUtility` class to generate a new ED25519 key pair:

[source, typescript]
----
import { KeysUtility } from "@hashgraph-did-sdk/core";

const keys = KeysUtility.generateEd25519KeyPair();

console.log(`Private Key: ${keys.privateKey}`);
console.log(`Public Key: ${keys.publicKey}`);
----

=== Transforming Keys

This example shows how to use the `KeysUtility` to transform keys between different formats:

[source, typescript]
----
import { KeysUtility } from "@hashgraph-did-sdk/core";
import { PublicKey } from "@hashgraph/sdk";

// Load a key from a Hedera PublicKey
const keyUtil = KeysUtility.fromPublicKey(publicKey); 

// Transform the key to different formats
const publicKeyMultibase = keyUtil.toMultibase();
const publicKeyBase58 = keyUtil.toBase58();  
const publicKeyBytes = keyUtil.toBytes();
----
