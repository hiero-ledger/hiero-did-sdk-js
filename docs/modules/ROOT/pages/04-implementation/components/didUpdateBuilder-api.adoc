== Constructor

=== `constructor`
[source,ts]
----
constructor(did: string)
----

Initializes a new `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance.

Parameters::
* `did`: The DID string of the Decentralized Identifier to update.


== Methods

=== `addAuthenticationMethod` [[method-addAuthenticationMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public addAuthenticationMethod(methodOrId: VerificationMethod | string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Adds an authentication method to the DID document. If a verification method with the same ID already exists, it will be replaced.
A authentication method is a public key that can be used to authenticate the DID subject.

Parameters::
* `methodOrId`: The <<verification-method-type,VerificationMethod>> object or the identifier of the verification method as a source.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `removeAuthenticationMethod` [[method-removeAuthenticationMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public removeAuthenticationMethod(methodId: string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Removes an authentication method from the DID document by its identifier.

Parameters::
* `methodId`: The identifier of the authentication method to be removed.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `addAssertionMethod` [[method-addAssertionMethod]]
[source,ts]

public addAssertionMethod(methodOrId: VerificationMethod | string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Adds an assertion method to the DID document. If a verification method with the same ID already exists, it will be replaced.
A assertion method is a public key that can be used to express claims, such as for the purposes of issuing a Verifiable Credential

Parameters::
* `methodOrId`: The <<verification-method-type,VerificationMethod>> object or the identifier of the verification method as a source.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `removeAssertionMethod` [[method-removeAssertionMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public removeAssertionMethod(methodId: string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Removes an assertion method from the DID document by its identifier.

Parameters::
* `methodId`: The identifier of the assertion method to be removed.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `addKeyAgreementMethod` [[method-addKeyAgreementMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public addKeyAgreementMethod(methodOrId: VerificationMethod | string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Adds a key agreement method to the DID document. If a verification method with the same ID already exists, it will be replaced.
A key agreement method is a public key that can be used to derive a shared secret for secure communication.

Parameters::
* `methodOrId`: The <<verification-method-type,VerificationMethod>> object or the identifier of the verification method as a source.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `removeKeyAgreementMethod` [[method-removeKeyAgreementMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public removeKeyAgreementMethod(methodId: string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Removes a key agreement method from the DID document by its identifier.

Parameters::
* `methodId`: The identifier of the key agreement method to be removed.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `addCapabilityInvocationMethod` [[method-addCapabilityInvocationMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public addCapabilityInvocationMethod(methodOrId: VerificationMethod | string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Adds a capability invocation method to the DID document. If a verification method with the same ID already exists, it will be replaced.
A capability invocation method is a public key that can be used to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the authorization to update the DID Document.

Parameters::
* `methodOrId`: The <<verification-method-type,VerificationMethod>> object or the identifier of the verification method as a source.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `removeCapabilityInvocationMethod` [[method-removeCapabilityInvocationMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public removeCapabilityInvocationMethod(methodId: string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Removes a capability invocation method from the DID document by its identifier.

Parameters::
* `methodId`: The identifier of the capability invocation method to be removed.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `addCapabilityDelegationMethod` [[method-addCapabilityDelegationMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public addCapabilityDelegationMethod(methodOrId: VerificationMethod | string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Adds a capability delegation method to the DID document. If a verification method with the same ID already exists, it will be replaced.
A capability delegation method is a public key that can be used to delegate authority to another party.

Parameters::
* `methodOrId`: The <<verification-method-type,VerificationMethod>> object or the identifier of the verification method as a source.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `removeCapabilityDelegationMethod` [[method-removeCapabilityDelegationMethod]]
[source,ts]
----
public removeCapabilityDelegationMethod(methodId: string): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Removes a capability delegation method from the DID document by its identifier.

Parameters::
* `methodId`: The identifier of the capability delegation method to be removed.

Returns::
The current `DIDUpdateBuilder` instance for method chaining.

=== `addService` [[method-addService]]
[source,ts]
----
public addService(service: Service): DIDUpdateBuilder {}
----

Adds a service to the DID document. If a service with the same ID already exists, it will be replaced.

Parameters::
* `service`: The <<service-type,Service>> object to be added.
