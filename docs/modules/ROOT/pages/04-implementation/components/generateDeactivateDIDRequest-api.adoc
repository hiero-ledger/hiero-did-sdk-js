= generateDeactivateDIDRequest API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the `generateDeactivateDIDRequest` function within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Function Signature

This function generates a request to deactivate a Decentralized Identifier (DID) on the Hedera network using the xref:04-implementation/guides/key-management-modes-guide.adoc#client-managed-secret-mode[Client Managed Secret Mode].

The `generateDeactivateDIDRequest` function is invoked with `providers` and `options` parameters. The `providers` parameter encapsulates configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network, while the `options` parameter provides relevant configuration options for the DID deactivation request.
