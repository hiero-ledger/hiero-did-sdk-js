= deactivateDID API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the `deactivateDID` function within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Function Signature

The `deactivateDID` function allows you to deactivate an existing DID.

[source,js]
----
function deactivateDID(
  options: DeactivateDIDOptions,
  providers: Providers
): Promise<DeactivateDIDResult>;
----

== Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

*   **`providers`:** (Required) An object encapsulating configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network.
*   **`options`:** (Required) An object containing the DID to deactivate.

=== providers Parameter

The table below details the structure of the `providers` parameter.

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Description

|providers
|`Providers`
|An object containing a Hedera Client, a cryptographic Signer, and a transaction Publisher (refer to <<providers-data-types>> for details).
|===


=== options Parameter

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",frame="ends"]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Description

|did
|`string`
|The DID string of the Decentralized Identifier to deactivate.

|privateKey?
|`string` \| PrivateKey`
|A private key (in DER format) or a `PrivateKey` object used to generate a xref:04-implementation/components/signer-guide.adoc[Signer] for signing the DID deactivate message. If neither this parameter nor `signer` (in the `providers` parameter) is specified, a new key pair is generated.

|waitForDIDVisibility?
|`boolean`
|Whether to wait for the DID to be **visible** on the network. The DID registration transaction may be confirmed before the DID is actually accessible and usable on the network. This option ensures that the function waits until the DID is fully propagated and discoverable. If set to `false`, the function will return as soon as the registration transaction is confirmed, which may be faster but could lead to errors if you immediately try to use the DID. 

Defaults to `true`.

|visibilityTimeoutMs?
|`number`
|The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for the DID to be **visible** on the network. This option is only relevant if `waitForDIDVisibility` is set to `true`. If the DID is not visible within this timeout period, the function will throw an error. Defaults to 120000 milliseconds (2 minutes).

== Data Types

This section elaborates on the data types employed within the `providers` parameter.

[[providers-data-types]]
=== Providers Type

To utilize this type, at least one of the following must be defined: `client` or `publisher`. If both are provided, `publisher` takes precedence.

The table below provides a detailed description of the `Providers` type.

|Description

|clientOptions?
|`ClientOptions`
|Configuration options for instantiating a Hedera Client.  See a full running link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/deactivateDID-with-client-options.ts[example] in the source code.

|client?
|`Client`
|An instance of a Hedera Client. See a full running link:https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/hashgraph-did-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/deactivateDID-with-a-client.ts[example] in the source code.

|signer?
|`Signer`
|An instance of a xref:04-implementation/components/signer-guide.adoc[Signer]. If not provided, a private key must be specified in the `options` parameter to sign the DID creation message; otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

|publisher?
|`Publisher`
|An instance of a xref:04-implementation/components/publisher-guide.adoc[Publisher] responsible for submitting the DID creation transaction to the Hedera network.
|===

== Return Value

Upon successful execution, the function returns a Promise that resolves to a `DeactivateDIDResult` object.

== Function Implementation

The Hashgraph DID SDK provides a `deactivateDID` function within its `registrar` package. For further details, refer to the xref:06-deployment/packages/index.adoc#essential-packages[`@hashgraph-did-sdk-js/registrar`] package documentation.
