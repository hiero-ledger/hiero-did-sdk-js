= Setup Hedera Development Node

include::../../shared/under-development.adoc[]

== Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a Hedera development node on your local machine. A development node allows you to interact with the Hedera network in a sandboxed environment, making it ideal for:

* **Learning and experimentation:** Explore Hedera Hashgraph concepts, APIs, and SDKs without incurring costs on the mainnet.
* **Application development:** Build and test your decentralized applications (dApps) locally before deploying them to a production environment.
* **Smart contract development:** Develop and debug your Solidity smart contracts in a controlled setting.

By following this guide, you'll be able to quickly set up a Hedera development node and start building on the Hashgraph.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Basic understanding of command-line interfaces:** You should be comfortable using a terminal or command prompt.
* **Docker:** Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download it from the official Docker website: [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)

**What you'll learn:**

* How to download and run a Hedera development node Docker image.
* How to configure your Hedera development node.
* How to interact with your node using the Hedera command-line tools.
