= Hedera DID Method

This guide provides an overview of the Hedera DID Method Specification, which defines how Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated on the Hedera network.

== DID Format

A Hedera DID adheres to the following format:

```
did:hedera:<network>:<base58-encoded-public-key>_<topic-id>
```

Where:

*   `<network>` is either `mainnet` or `testnet`.
*   `<base58-encoded-public-key>` is the base58 encoding of the DID's root public key.
*   `<topic-id>` is the ID of the Hedera topic associated with the DID.

This structure ensures that Hedera DIDs are easily identifiable and can be resolved to their corresponding DID Documents.

== CRUD Operations

The Hedera DID method utilizes the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to manage the lifecycle of DIDs. The following CRUD operations are supported:

*   **Create:** A new DID is created by sending a `ConsensusSubmitMessage` transaction to an HCS topic. The message includes the initial DID Document or DID Owner information.
*   **Read (Resolve):** A DID is resolved by reading messages from the associated HCS topic. The DID Document is constructed by processing the messages in chronological order.
*   **Update:**  A DID Document is updated by sending a `ConsensusSubmitMessage` transaction with an updated `DIDOwner`, `VerificationMethod`, or `VerificationRelationship`.
*   **Deactivate:** A DID is deactivated by sending a `ConsensusSubmitMessage` transaction with the `deactivate` operation.
*   **Delete:** A DID Document is deleted by sending a `ConsensusSubmitMessage` transaction with the `delete` operation.

These operations leverage the immutability and transparency of the Hedera network to provide a secure and auditable way to manage DIDs.

=== Create

To create a DID, you need to:

1.  Generate a key pair.
2.  Create an HCS topic.
3.  Submit a `create` message to the topic, including the DID Document or DID owner information.

The initial DID Document MUST contain a public key with the ID `#did-root-key` and type `Ed25519VerificationKey2018`.

=== Read (Resolve)

To resolve a DID, you need to:

1.  Retrieve the messages from the HCS topic associated with the DID.
2.  Process the messages to construct the current state of the DID Document.

If the most recent valid message has the `operation` set to `delete`, the DID Document returned MUST be empty.

=== Update

To update a DID, you need to:

1.  Submit an `update` message to the HCS topic associated with the DID.
2.  Include the changes to be made to the DID Document in the message payload.

The message payload can include updates to the DID Document's `DIDOwner`, `VerificationMethod`, or `VerificationRelationship`.

=== Deactivate

To deactivate a DID, you need to:

1.  Submit a `deactivate` message to the HCS topic associated with the DID.

This operation revokes the DID, making it unusable for further operations.

=== Delete

To delete a DID, you need to:

1.  Submit a `delete` message to the HCS topic associated with the DID.

This operation removes the DID's association with the Hedera topic.

== DID Messages

DID operations are performed using DID Messages, which are JSON objects containing information about the operation and the DID. Each message includes:

*   `operation`: The type of operation being performed (create, update, deactivate, or delete).
*   `did`: The DID string.
*   `event`: A Base64-encoded JSON object containing the data relevant to the operation.
*   `timestamp`: The message creation timestamp.
*   `signature`: A signature of the message content, signed by the DID controller's private key.

These messages are submitted to the HCS topic associated with the DID, creating a verifiable and tamper-proof record of DID operations.

== Event Payloads

DID Messages include an `event` property that contains the data relevant to the operation. The following event types are supported:

*   `DIDDocument`:  A reference to a DID Document stored in IPFS.
*   `DIDOwner`:  Information about the DID's controller and public key.
*   `VerificationMethod`:  A cryptographic public key associated with the DID.
*   `VerificationRelationship`:  The relationship between the DID subject and a verification method (e.g., authentication, assertion).
*   `Service`:  A service endpoint associated with the DID.

These events allow for flexible and granular updates to the DID Document, enabling various use cases and interactions.

== Security and Privacy Considerations

The Hedera DID method inherits the security properties of the Hedera network, including its hashgraph consensus algorithm, proof-of-stake model, and fee structure. This ensures the integrity and availability of DID data.

Privacy considerations include avoiding the inclusion of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in DID Documents and mitigating the risk of correlation by using unique DIDs and keys for different interactions.
