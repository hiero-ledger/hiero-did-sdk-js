= Getting Started with the Hedera DID SDK

== Introduction

Welcome to the Hedera DID SDK! This guide provides a quick and practical introduction to creating and managing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on the Hedera network.

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity.  The Hedera DID SDK empowers you to leverage this technology for your applications, providing:

* **Enhanced Security:** DIDs give users greater control over their digital identities and reduce the reliance on centralized authorities.
* **Improved Privacy:**  DIDs can be used to selectively disclose information, minimizing the data shared with third parties.
* **Increased Trust:**  DIDs are anchored to the Hedera blockchain, providing a tamper-proof and auditable record of identity information.

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get you started with the Hedera DID SDK. You'll learn how to install the SDK, create your first DID, and resolve its DID document.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* **Hedera Account:** You'll need a Hedera account with some hbars to pay for transaction fees. You can create one on the Hedera Portal: https://portal.hedera.com/
* **(Optional) Basic understanding of DIDs:** Familiarity with the concept of DIDs is helpful but not required. If you're new to DIDs, you can learn more here: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/


**Let's get started!**

=== 1. Install the SDK

Use npm or yarn to install the necessary packages:

[source,bash]
----
npm install @hashgraph/sdk @hashgraph-did-js-sdk/registrar @hashgraph-did-js-sdk/resolver
----

or

[source,bash]
----
yarn add @hashgraph/sdk @hashgraph-did-js-sdk/registrar @hashgraph-did-js-sdk/resolver
----

=== 2.  Set up your environment

* **Create a `.env` file:**  Store your Hedera account ID and private key securely in a `.env` file in your project directory.

[source,bash]
----
# .env
HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.12345 
HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
----

* **Import and configure the SDK:**

[source,javascript]
----
import { Client, PrivateKey } from "@hashgraph/sdk";

require("dotenv").config();

const myAccountId = process.env.HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID;
const myPrivateKey = PrivateKey.fromString(process.env.HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY);

const client = Client.forTestnet(); // Use Client.forMainnet() for mainnet
client.setOperator(myAccountId, myPrivateKey); 
----

=== 3. Create your first DID

[source,javascript]
----
import { createDID } from "@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/registrar"; // Import from registrar

async function createMyDID() {
  const { did, didDocument } = await createDID({
    providers: {
      testnet: client, // or for mainnet: { mainnet: client }
    }
  });

  console.log(`Created DID: ${did}`);
  console.log(`DID Document: ${JSON.stringify(didDocument, null, 2)}`);
}

createMyDID();
----

This code will:

* Import the `createDID` function from the `@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/registrar` package.
* Invoke the `createDID` function with a `providers` object containing your configured Hedera client.
* Generate a new DID with default settings.
* Output the generated DID string (e.g., `did:hedera:testnet:z6Mkhj...`) and its associated DID document, which contains important information about the DID.

=== 4. Resolve a DID Document

[source,javascript]
----
import { resolveDID } from "@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/resolver";

async function resolveMyDID(did) {
  const didDocument = await resolveDID(did);

  console.log(`Resolved DID Document: ${JSON.stringify(didDocument, null, 2)}`);
}

resolveMyDID("did:hedera:testnet:xxxxxxxx..."); // Replace with the DID you created
----

This code demonstrates how to:

* Use the `resolveDID` function from the resolver package.
* Fetch and display the DID document associated with a given DID string. This allows you to verify the authenticity and retrieve information linked to the DID.

== Next Steps

* **Explore the DID SDK documentation:**  Dive deeper into the features and functionality of the SDK. You can find comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples on the Hedera website.
* **Learn about DID methods:** Understand the different DID methods supported by Hedera, such as `did:hedera:mainnet` and `did:hedera:testnet`.
* **Build your decentralized identity solution:** Start developing your application using the Hedera DID SDK!
