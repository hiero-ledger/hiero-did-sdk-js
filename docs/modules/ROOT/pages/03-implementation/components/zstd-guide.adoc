= Zstd Guide

The `@hiero-did-sdk/zstd` package provides utilities for efficient data compression and decompression using the Zstandard (ZSTD) algorithm.

== Overview

This package is **cross-platform** and fully supports both Node.js, browsers, and React Native environments. You can safely use it in web, server, or mobile (React Native) projects.

You can use Zstd in your application to:
- Reduce the size of messages before network transmission.
- Optimize DID data storage.
- Enable other scenarios where data compression improves efficiency.

== Platform Compatibility

* **Cross-platform:** Works in Node.js, browsers, and React Native out of the box.
* **React Native:** Fully compatible and tested with the React Native runtime.

== Basic Usage

=== Compressing Data

[source,typescript]
----
import { compress } from '@hiero-did-sdk/zstd';

const data = new Uint8Array([/* ...raw bytes... */]);
const compressed = await compress(data);
----

=== Decompressing Data

[source,typescript]
----
import { decompress } from '@hiero-did-sdk/zstd';

const original = await decompress(compressed);
----

== Recommendations

* Use compression when sending large DID messages or saving data where space is limited.
* For small payloads, check if compression actually saves space.
* Always validate decompressed data for integrity after decompression.
