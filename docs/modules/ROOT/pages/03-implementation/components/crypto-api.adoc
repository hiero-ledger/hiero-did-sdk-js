= Crypto API Reference

This document describes the API for the `@hiero-did-sdk/crypto` package, providing cryptographic primitives for the Hiero DID SDK.

== Platform Compatibility

- The package is **cross-platform** and supports Node.js, all major browsers, and **React Native**.
- Works out of the box—no additional dependencies or polyfills are required for use in React Native or browsers.
- Consistent API and predictable behavior across all environments.

== Classes

=== Crypto

A static utility class that provides cryptographic operations.

==== Methods

===== sha256

[source,typescript]
----
static sha256(data: HashInput): string
----

Computes the SHA-256 hash of the given data and returns a hexadecimal string representation.

Parameters::
* `data` — Input to hash. Can be a `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Buffer`, or `string`.

Returns::
* `string` — The SHA-256 hash as a hexadecimal string.

Throws::
* Throws if the input data is null, undefined, or not a supported type.

== Types

=== HashInput

The input type accepted by the `sha256` method. Can be one of:
- `Uint8Array`
- `ArrayBuffer`
- `Buffer`
- `string`

== Usage Example

See xref:03-implementation/components/crypto-guide.adoc[Crypto Guide] for common usage patterns and recommendations.

== Implementation Notes

- All cryptographic routines use secure, widely-accepted libraries under the hood per environment.
- The API is synchronous for SHA-256 as it is typically performant and available natively.
- Full support and compatibility ensured for React Native, Node.js, and browser environments.
