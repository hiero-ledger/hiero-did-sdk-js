= Client Guide

The `@hiero-did-sdk/client` package simplifies configuration and management of Hedera Client connections for DID operations.

== Overview

Use `@hiero-did-sdk/client` to:
- Configure and instantiate Hedera network clients with various authentication and network options.
- Manage network connections for mainnet, testnet, previewnet, or custom Hedera nodes.
- Provide reusable client instances for transaction signing, publishing, and registry operations throughout the SDK and user applications.

== Basic Usage

=== Creating a Client

[source,typescript]
----
import { HederaClientService } from '@hiero-did-sdk/client';

const config = {
  accountId: '0.0.xxxx',
  privateKey: '302e0...xxx',
  network: 'testnet',
};

const clientService = new HederaClientService(config);
const client = clientService.getClient('testnet');
----

=== Using withClient Utility

[source,typescript]
----
await clientService.withClient(
  { networkName: 'testnet' },
  async (client) => {
    // Use the client for transactions, queries, etc.
  }
);
----

== Recommendations

- Always close the client after usage if using low-level SDK instance directly.
- Prefer `withClient` for automatic resource management.
- Store client configuration securely and never commit secrets to source control.
