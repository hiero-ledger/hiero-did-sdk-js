==== Methods

- `getClient(networkName?: string): Client`
  * Instantiate or retrieve a Hedera Client for a given network.
- `withClient(props: NetworkName, operation: (client: Client) => Promise<T>): Promise<T>`
  * Run an operation in the context of a managed client, closing the client automatically after completion.
