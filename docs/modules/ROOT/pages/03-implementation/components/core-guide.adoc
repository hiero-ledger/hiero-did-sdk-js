= Core

The Core component is the foundation of the Hiero DID SDK. It provides essential interfaces, utilities, and validation tools for working with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on the Hedera network.

== Key Features

=== Interfaces

The core component defines several key interfaces that are used throughout the Hiero DID SDK:

*   `DIDDocument`: Represents a DID Document, which contains information about a DID, such as its public keys and services.
*   `Signer`:  Defines the methods for signing and verifying data using a DID's private key.
*   `Publisher`: Defines the methods for submitting transactions to the Hedera network.
*   `Verifier`: Defines the methods for verifying the signatures of DID operations.
*   `DIDMessage`:  Represents a message used for DID operations, such as creating, updating, or deactivating a DID.
*   `PublicKey`: An interface for representing public keys.
*   `Network`: An interface for defining Hedera network configurations.
*   `VerificationMethodProperties`: An interface for defining verification method properties.
*   `DIDError`: A custom error class for all SDK-related errors.

=== Utilities

The core component also provides a range of utility classes and functions for working with DIDs and keys:

*   **Transforming keys:** Convert keys between different formats (bytes, base58, multibase, Hedera `PublicKey`).
*   **Multibase encoding:** Encode and decode data using the multibase encoding format.
*   **CBOR encoding:** Encode and decode data using the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) format.
*   **Public key validation:** Validate Ed25519 public keys.

=== DID Validation

The core component exports the `isHederaDID` function, which uses regular expressions to validate Hedera DIDs, ensuring they adhere to the DID specification:

*   Checks for correct DID format, including the `did:hedera` prefix, network, public key, and topic ID.
*   Validates the network identifier against allowed values (mainnet, testnet).
*   Uses a regular expression to validate the base58-encoded public key.


== Usage Examples

=== Validating a Hedera DID

The `isHederaDID` function is used to validate Hedera DIDs. It checks the format of the DID, including the network identifier, public key, and topic ID. You can use `isHederaDIDUrl` to validate a DID URL, which includes a fragment identifier.

This example demonstrates how to use the `isHederaDID` function to validate a Hedera DID:

[source, typescript]
----
import { isHederaDID } from "@hiero-did-sdk/core";

const did = "did:hedera:testnet:z6Mkhj..."; // Replace with the DID you want to validate

if (isHederaDID(did)) {
  console.log(`${did} is a valid Hedera DID`);
} else {
  console.log(`${did} is not a valid Hedera DID`);
}
----

This example demonstrates how to use the `isHederaDIDUrl` function to validate a DID URL:

[source, typescript]
----
import { isHederaDIDUrl } from "@hiero-did-sdk/core";

const did = "did:hedera:testnet:z6Mkhj...#some-fragment"; // Replace with the DID URL you want to validate

if (isHederaDIDUrl(did)) {
  console.log(`${did} is a valid Hedera DID`);
} else {
  console.log(`${did} is not a valid Hedera DID`);
}
----

=== Validating a Ed25519 Public Key

The `isEd25519PublicKey` function is used to validate Ed25519 public keys. It only checks the length of the key. You can pass a multibase-encoded key or raw bytes to the function.

This example demonstrates how to use the `isEd25519PublicKey` function to validate an Ed25519 public key:

[source, typescript]
----
import { isEd25519PublicKey } from "@hiero-did-sdk/core";

const publicKey = "z6Mkhj..."; // Replace with the public key you want to validate

if (isEd25519PublicKey(publicKey)) {
  console.log(`${publicKey} is a valid Ed25519 public key`);
} else {
  console.log(`${publicKey} is not a valid Ed25519 public key`);
}
----


=== Transforming Keys

`KeysUtility` provides a range of functions for transforming keys between different formats. Currently, the utility supports the following key formats:

*   **Bytes:** Raw bytes of the key.
*   **Base58:** Base58-encoded key.
*   **Multibase:** Multibase-encoded key.
*   **Hedera `PublicKey`:** Hedera SDK `PublicKey` object.
*   **DER String:** DER-encoded key.

This example shows how to use the `KeysUtility` to transform keys from a Hedera `PublicKey` to different formats:

[source, typescript]
----
import { KeysUtility } from "@hiero-did-sdk/core";
import { PublicKey } from "@hashgraph/sdk";

// Load a key from a Hedera PublicKey
const keyUtil = KeysUtility.fromPublicKey(publicKey);

// Transform the key to different formats
const publicKeyMultibase = keyUtil.toMultibase();
const publicKeyBase58 = keyUtil.toBase58();
const publicKeyBytes = keyUtil.toBytes();
----

=== Multibase Encoding

The core package provides a `MultibaseCodec` class for encoding and decoding multibase strings. Multibase is a self-describing encoding format that allows you to encode data in different base encodings (e.g., base58, base64, base32).

This example demonstrates how to use the `MultibaseCodec` class to encode and decode multibase strings:

[source, typescript]
----
import { MultibaseCodec } from "@hiero-did-sdk/core";

const encodedString = MultibaseCodec.encode(Buffer.from("Hello, world!"), "base58btc");

const decodedString = MultibaseCodec.decode(encodedString);
----

=== CBOR Encoding

The `CborCodec` class is provided for encoding and decoding data using the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) format. CBOR is a binary data serialization format that is more compact than JSON and is used to encode structured data.

This example demonstrates how to use the `CborCodec` class to encode and decode data using the CBOR format:

[source, typescript]
----
import { CborCodec } from "@hiero-did-sdk/core";

const encodedBytes = CborCodec.encode(JSON.stringify({ id: 'did:hedera:...' }));

const decodedObjectInBytes = CborCodec.decode(encodedBytes);
