= HCS Guide

The `@hiero-did-sdk/hcs` package provides powerful tools and services for interacting with Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) topics, files, and messages.

== Overview

Use `@hiero-did-sdk/hcs` to:
- Create, update, and delete HCS topics.
- Publish, retrieve, and manage messages in HCS topics.
- Store and retrieve files (including chunked files) using Hedera Consensus Service file abstraction.
- Integrate caching and efficient retrieval for topic metadata and info.

== Basic Usage

=== Creating a Topic

[source,typescript]
----
import { HcsTopicService } from '@hiero-did-sdk/hcs';

const service = new HcsTopicService(client);
const topicId = await service.createTopic({ topicMemo: "Demo Topic" });
console.log(topicId);
----

=== Publishing Messages

Publishing is typically handled directly with the Hedera SDK, but HCS topic info management and optimizations are handled by this package.

=== Fetching Topic Info

[source,typescript]
----
const topicInfo = await service.getTopicInfo({ topicId });
console.log(topicInfo);
----

=== Storing Files

[source,typescript]
----
import { HcsFileService } from '@hiero-did-sdk/hcs';

const fileService = new HcsFileService(client);
await fileService.submitFile({
  topicId,
  payload: Buffer.from("important data"),
  networkName: "testnet",
});
// Additional chunking is handled automatically for large payloads.
----

=== Reading Files

[source,typescript]
----
const file = await fileService.resolveFile({ topicId, networkName: "testnet" });
console.log(file.toString());
----

== Recommendations

- Use automatic chunking for large files to ensure reliable data delivery.
- Cache topic info for performance in long-lived apps.
- Always handle possible errors on creation, update, and deletion operations for proper error flows.
