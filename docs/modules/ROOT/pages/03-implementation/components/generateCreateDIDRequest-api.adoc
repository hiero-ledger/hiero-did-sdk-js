= generateCreateDIDRequest API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the `generateCreateDIDRequest` function within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript.

== Function Signature

This function generates a request to create a new Decentralized Identifier (DID) on the Hedera network using the xref:04-implementation/guides/key-management-modes-guide.adoc#client-managed-secret-mode[Client Managed Secret Mode].

The `generateCreateDIDRequest` function is invoked with `providers` and `options` parameters. The `providers` parameter encapsulates configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network, while the `options` parameter enables customization of the DID creation procedure and passing required public key.

[source,js]
----
function generateCreateDIDRequest(
  options: GenerateCreateDIDRequestOptions,
  providers: PublisherProviders,
): Promise<CreateDIDRequest>;
----

== Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

*   **`providers`**:  (Required) An object encapsulating configuration parameters for interacting with the Hedera network.
*   **`options`**: (Required) An object containing a public key for DID root key and enabling customization of the DID creation procedure.
