The `@hiero-did-sdk/crypto` package provides essential cryptographic utilities for the Hiero DID SDK, including hashing and data integrity features.

== Overview

This package is **cross-platform** and fully supports Node.js, browsers, and React Native environments. You can use it confidently in server-side, web, or mobile (React Native) projects.

`@hiero-did-sdk/crypto` enables secure and consistent cryptographic operations required for DID communications, signature verification, data hashing and integrity checking across all supported platforms.

== Platform Compatibility

* **Cross-platform:** Works in Node.js, browsers, and React Native without extra dependencies.
* **React Native:** Thoroughly tested to ensure full compatibility with React Native runtime.

== Basic Usage

=== Hashing Data (SHA-256)

[source,typescript]
----
import { Crypto } from '@hiero-did-sdk/crypto';

const data = new Uint8Array([/* ...data... */]);
const hashHex = Crypto.sha256(data);
console.log(hashHex); // Prints SHA-256 hash as a hexadecimal string
----

You can provide the input as `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Buffer`, or a standard string.

== Recommendations

- Use SHA-256 hashing to ensure the integrity of critical data and messages.
- Always compare cryptographic hashes using secure equality checks, especially for authentication or signature validation.
- Avoid exposing raw cryptographic material to client-side code when not required by your flow.
