= Crypto Library Guide

The `@hiero-did-sdk/crypto` package provides a simple utility class `Crypto` for calculating SHA-256 hashes. It supports multiple input types and works seamlessly in both Node.js and React Native environments by automatically selecting the appropriate crypto backend.

== Overview

Use the `Crypto` library to:

* Compute SHA-256 hashes of data inputs (string, Buffer, Uint8Array, ArrayBuffer).
* Automatically select the compatible crypto module depending on the runtime environment.
* Obtain hexadecimal string hashes for use in decentralized identity and cryptographic operations.

== Initialization

No explicit initialization is required. The library detects and uses the appropriate crypto module internally when hashing.

== Basic Usage

[source,typescript]
----
import { Crypto } from '@hiero-did-sdk/crypto';

const input = 'Hello, World!';

const hashHex = Crypto.sha256(input);

console.log('SHA-256 hash:', hashHex);
----

Parameters:

* `input` (string | Buffer | Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer) — data to hash.

Returns:

* `string` — hex-encoded SHA-256 hash.

Throws an error if no compatible crypto module is found during runtime.
