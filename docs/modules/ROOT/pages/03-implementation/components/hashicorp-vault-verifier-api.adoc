= HashiCorp Vault Verifier API Reference

This document provides a concise API reference for the Vault `Verifier` class within the Hedera DID SDK for JavaScript. This class is responsible for verifying signatures using HashiCorp Vault as the key store.

== Class Diagram

The class diagram below illustrates the core methods of the Vault `Verifier` interface for interacting with cryptographic keys stored in HashiCorp Vault.

== Constructor

=== `constructor`
[source,ts]
----
constructor(options: VerifierOptions)
----

Initializes a new `Verifier` instance.

Parameters::
* `options`: (Required) An object containing the necessary options to create a `Verifier` instance (refer to <<options-data-types>> for details).

== Methods

=== `publicKey`
[source,ts]
----
publicKey(): string
----

Returns the public key associated with the `Verifier` instance in DER format.

Returns::
The public key in DER format.

=== `verify`
[source,ts]
----
verify(message: Uint8Array, signature: Uint8Array): boolean
----

Verifies the given signature using the public key stored in HashiCorp Vault.

Parameters::
* `message`: The message that was signed.
* `signature`: The signature to be verified.

Returns::
`true` if the signature is valid, `false` otherwise.
