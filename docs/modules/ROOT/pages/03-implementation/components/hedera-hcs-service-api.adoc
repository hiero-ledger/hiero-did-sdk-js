= HCS API Reference

This document describes the API for the `@hiero-did-sdk/hcs` package, providing utilities for interacting with Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) topics, files, and messages.

== Classes

=== HcsTopicService

Manages the lifecycle and metadata of Hedera Consensus Service topics.

==== Methods

- `createTopic(props?: CreateTopicProps): Promise<string>`
  * Create a new topic with optional configuration (memo, keys, auto-renew, etc).
- `updateTopic(props: UpdateTopicProps): Promise<void>`
  * Update topic parameters (memo, keys, auto-renew, and others).
- `deleteTopic(props: DeleteTopicProps): Promise<void>`
  * Delete a topic.
- `getTopicInfo(props: GetTopicInfoProps): Promise<TopicInfo>`
  * Load topic info (fetches and caches details where supported).


=== HcsFileService

Enables storage and retrieval of arbitrary files (including chunked upload/download) via Hedera Consensus Service.

==== Methods

- `submitFile(props: SubmitFileProps): Promise<string>`
  * Store a binary payload as a file on a topic, using chunked messages if required.
- `resolveFile(props: ResolveFileProps): Promise<Buffer>`
  * Fetch and assemble a file payload from HCS topic messages.

=== HcsMessageService

Provides additional higher-level message sending/receiving functionality and utilities.

==== Methods

- See source for advanced messaging scenarios.

=== HcsCacheService

Optionally used to improve performance when reading topic metadata and reduce network load.

==== Overview

- Works transparently with `HcsTopicService`.
- Can be configured on initialization or injected.

== Types

- `CreateTopicProps`, `UpdateTopicProps`, `DeleteTopicProps`, `GetTopicInfoProps`
- `SubmitFileProps`, `ResolveFileProps`
- `HcsFileChunkMessage`, `TopicInfo`

== Implementation Notes

- Chunking and async retrieval are automatic for large file operations.
- Robust error handling is built in for all lifecycle and file/message operations.
- Topic and file APIs are designed to work directly with the Hedera SDK clients.
