= Publisher Class

The `Publisher` is a core component within the Hiero DID SDK. It streamlines interactions with the distributed ledger by providing a standardized way to submit, execute, and pay for transactions. This ensures that DID-related operations are reliably processed and recorded on the network. The `Publisher` interface promotes interoperability and simplifies the development of DID applications, abstracting away the complexities of direct ledger interactions.

== Features

*   **Transaction Submission:**  Submits transactions to the Hedera network for DID operations.
*   **Transaction Execution:**  Executes transactions on the Hedera network, ensuring reliable processing.
*   **Network Interaction:** Provides a streamlined interface for interacting with the Hedera network.
*   **Network Detection:** Automatically detects the Hedera network environment (mainnet, testnet).
*   **Error Handling:**  Includes robust error handling for transaction failures and network issues.
*   **Extensibility:** Designed for extensibility to support future Hedera network features.
*   **TypeScript Support:** Built with TypeScript to enhance developer experience and type safety.

== Using the Publisher

=== Submitting a Transaction

This example demonstrates how to submit a simple transaction using the `Publisher`:

[source, typescript]
----
import { Publisher } from "@hiero-did-sdk/publisher-internal";
import { Client, PrivateKey, TransferTransaction } from "@hashgraph/sdk";

async function main() {
  // Configure the Hedera client
  const client = Client.forTestnet();
  const privateKey = PrivateKey.fromString("your-private-key-here");
  client.setOperator("your-account-id-here", privateKey);

  // Create a new Publisher instance
  const publisher = new Publisher(client);

  // Create a simple transfer transaction (replace with your actual transaction)
  const transaction = new TransferTransaction()
    .addHbarTransfer("your-account-id-here", -1) // Sending 1 HBAR
    .addHbarTransfer("0.0.3", 1); // To account 0.0.3

  // Submit the transaction
  try {
    const receipt = await publisher.publish(transaction);
    console.log(`Transaction Receipt: ${JSON.stringify(receipt, null, 2)}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error submitting transaction:", error);
  }
}

main();
