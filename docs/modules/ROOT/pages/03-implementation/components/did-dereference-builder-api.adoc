= DIDDereferenceBuilder API Reference

This document provides a detailed API reference for the `DIDDereferenceBuilder` class â€” a utility to dereference fragments or queries from a DID Resolution result, returning relevant pieces of a DID Document in various formats.

== Class: DIDDereferenceBuilder

A builder class responsible for dereferencing parts (fragments or query parameters) of a DID Document, based on the DID Resolution object.

=== `constructor`
[source,ts]
----
private constructor(didResolution: DIDResolution)
----

Creates an instance of `DIDDereferenceBuilder` with a resolved DID Document.

.Parameters
* `didResolution` (DIDResolution, required): The DID resolution result containing the DID Document and associated metadata.

.Note
* The constructor is private. Use the static method `fromResolution` to instantiate.

=== `withFragment`
[source,ts]
----
withFragment(fragment?: string): this
----

Sets a fragment identifier (the part after `#` in a DID URL) to dereference within the DID Document.

.Parameters
* `fragment` (string, optional): The fragment identifier to dereference.

.Returns
* The current instance for method chaining.

=== `withParams`
[source,ts]
----
withParams(params: Record<string, string>): this
----

Sets query parameters (key-value pairs after `?` in a DID URL) to dereference within the DID Document.

.Parameters
* `params` (object, required): A record/map of query parameters for dereferencing.

.Returns
* The current instance for method chaining.

=== `toJson`
[source,ts]
----
toJson(): Service | VerificationMethod | ServiceEndpoint
----

Dereferences the specified fragment or query parameters from the DID Document, returning the corresponding JSON content.

.Behavior
* If a fragment is set, attempts to find the matching element (Service or VerificationMethod) in the DID Document by ID.
* If query parameters are set, attempts to resolve service endpoints based on parameter keys.
* If neither fragment nor valid params are set, throws an error.

.Throws
* `DIDError` with code `'notFound'` if the fragment or query target is not found in the DID Document.
* `DIDError` with code `'invalidDidUrl'` if unsupported or invalid URL parameters are present.
* `DIDError` with code `'representationNotSupported'` if the service endpoint's representation is unsupported (e.g., multiple endpoints or non-string endpoints).

.Returns
* The dereferenced JSON object, which can be a:
  ** `Service` object
  ** `VerificationMethod` object
  ** `ServiceEndpoint` string

=== `toJsonLd`
[source,ts]
----
toJsonLd(): JsonLdService | JsonLdVerificationMethod | ServiceEndpoint
----

Returns the dereferenced JSON content, wrapped as JSON-LD with `@context` from the DID Document.

.Returns
* A JSON-LD wrapped object including:
  ** `@context`: The original DID Document contexts.
  ** Other properties: The dereferenced JSON content.

=== `toResolution`
[source,ts]
----
toResolution(): DIDDereferenceResolution
----

Builds a full DID Dereference Resolution object containing dereferenced content along with metadata.

.Returns
* An object containing:
 ** `contentStream`: The dereferenced JSON-LD content.
 ** `dereferencingMetadata`: Metadata of the DID Document (from the original DID Resolution).
 ** `contentMetadata`: Resolution metadata from the original DID Resolution.

=== `toCbor`
[source,ts]
----
toCbor(): Uint8Array
----

Encodes the dereferenced JSON content as CBOR format.

.Returns
* A `Uint8Array` containing the CBOR encoded dereferenced content.

=== `dereferenceFragment`
[source,ts]
----
private dereferenceFragment(): Service | VerificationMethod | null
----

Searches the DID Document for an item matching the specified fragment identifier.

.Returns
* The matched `Service` or `VerificationMethod` object if found, otherwise `null`.

.Details
* Checks all DID Document properties that may hold arrays of services or verification methods.
* Matches on IDs equal to fragment or did-fragment.

=== `dereferenceQuery`
[source,ts]
----
private dereferenceQuery(): ServiceEndpoint | null
----

Resolves service endpoints based on the provided query parameters.

.Returns
* The resolved `ServiceEndpoint` string if found, otherwise `null`.

.Throws
* `DIDError` with code `'invalidDidUrl'` if unsupported parameters (`hl`, `versionTime`, `versionId`) are included.
* `DIDError` with code `'representationNotSupported'` if multiple endpoints are found or the endpoint is not a string.

.Details
* Searches the DID Document's `service` array for a service with an ID matching the `service` query param.
* Supports optional `relativeRef` to append to the service endpoint URL.

=== `fromResolution`
[source,ts]
----
static fromResolution(resolution: DIDResolution)
----

Static factory method to create a new `DIDDereferenceBuilder` from a DID Resolution object.

.Parameters
* `resolution` (DIDResolution, required): The DID Resolution to dereference.

.Returns
* A new `DIDDereferenceBuilder` instance initialized with the given resolution.
