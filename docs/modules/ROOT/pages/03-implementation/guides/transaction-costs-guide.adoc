= Hashgraph DID SDK: Transaction Costs

This guide provides estimated transaction costs for various DID operations when using the Hashgraph DID SDK. Understanding these costs can help you plan and budget for your DID-related activities on the Hedera network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All costs provided in this guide are estimates and may change based on Hedera network conditions, transaction complexity, and future fee adjustments.

== DID Operation Cost Estimates

The following table summarizes the estimated costs for common DID operations:

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===
|Operation |Description |Estimated Cost (USD)
|createDID |Creating a new DID document with new topic | $0,0101
|createDID |Creating a new DID document on existing topic | $0.0001
|updateDID |Updating an existing DID document (per update) | $0.0001
|deactivateDID |Deactivating a DID document | $0.0001
|resolveDID |Resolving a DID | Free

== Detailed Cost Breakdown

=== createDID

Creating a DID document involves:

* A Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) topic creation (optional)
* A Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) message submission

*Factors affecting cost:*

* Message size
* Network congestion

=== updateDID

Each update to a DID document incurs a cost:

* A Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) message submission
* Cost may vary based on the size of the update

*Factors affecting cost:*

* Size of the update payload
* Network conditions

=== deactivateDID

Deactivating a DID is typically a lightweight operation:

* A Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) message submission
* Generally costs slightly less than creation or updates

=== resolveDID

Resolving a DID requires reading from the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) topic. This operation is free.
