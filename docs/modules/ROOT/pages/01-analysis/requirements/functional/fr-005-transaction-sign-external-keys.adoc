=== FR 005: Transaction And Operation Should Be Able To Sign With External Keys

==== Description

Any operation or transaction performed using the SDK should be able to be signed with external keys. Signing a transaction or operation with external keys involves using a key pair that is not managed by the SDK. This way, we will be able to sign transactions or operations with keys stored in a hardware wallet or any other external key management system.

==== Status

Draft

==== Acceptance Criteria

* The SDK should give ability to sign a transaction or operation with external keys.
* The SDK should provide a asynchronous method to sign a transaction or operation.
