=== FR 002: Manually Hedera Node Selection

==== Description

Some of the public nodes are not production ready and may not be available at all times. The SDK should provide an option to manually select the Hedera Node to interact with. Also some clients may want to interact with nodes that are geographically closer to them or have ownership of the nodes.

==== Status

Draft

==== Acceptance Criteria

* The SDK should provide an option to manually select the Hedera Node to interact with.
* This option should be available in the resolver and registration APIs.
