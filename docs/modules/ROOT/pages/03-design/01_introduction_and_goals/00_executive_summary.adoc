=== Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of an enhanced Hashgraph DID-SDK (Decentralized Identifier Software Development Kit) to address key limitations in the current implementation. This new SDK will empower developers to build secure, high-performance, and interoperable decentralized applications (dApps) on the Hedera Hashgraph network. By resolving performance bottlenecks, enhancing security, improving interoperability, and fixing critical bugs, the SDK will provide a robust foundation for decentralized identity management, ensuring scalability, reliability, and seamless integration within the Hedera ecosystem. 

==== Achievements:

* **In-Depth Analysis of Existing SDK**: A thorough review of the current Hashgraph DID-SDK, as detailed in xref:01-planning/hips/hip-0001-new-did-sdk.adoc[HIP-0001], has identified key limitations in performance, security, and interoperability, which have been addressed in the new design.

* **Community-Driven Design:**  The new SDK has been shaped by active engagement with the Hedera developer community, ensuring it aligns with the needs and expectations of the ecosystem.

* **Comprehensive Solution Design:** The new SDK offers a robust solution that incorporates essential features to address the limitations of the current SDK and significantly improve performance, security, and flexibility.

==== Goals:

* **Unlock High Performance:** By enabling asynchronous cryptographic operations, the SDK will allow the development of applications that are both responsive and scalable, even under high-demand scenarios.

* **Maximize Security:** Flexible key management options, including External Secret Mode and Client-managed Secret Mode, will give developers the tools to implement robust security measures tailored to their specific application needs.

* **Facilitate Seamless Integration:** Multibase encoding will be integrated to enhance interoperability, ensuring seamless communication between decentralized applications and a wide range of systems and technologies, both within and outside the blockchain space.

* **Ensure Reliability:** By addressing critical bugs identified in the current SDK, including issues with message verification and signature validation, the new SDK will maintain stability, reliability, and data integrity, providing a trusted foundation for decentralized applications.

* **Foster Open Collaboration:** An open-source reference implementation and comprehensive documentation will encourage community contributions and feedback, fostering a collaborative environment across the Hedera ecosystem.

==== Key Components

To achieve these ambitious goals, the enhanced Hashgraph DID-SDK will incorporate the following key components:

* **Asynchronous Cryptographic Operations:** The SDK will implement asynchronous cryptographic operations to eliminate performance bottlenecks, improving the responsiveness and efficiency of applications, particularly under high-load conditions. This will enable dApps to handle a larger volume of transactions with reduced latency.

* **Flexible Key Management:** The SDK will support both External Secret Mode and Client-managed Secret Mode, providing developers with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate key management strategy for their specific security and operational needs.

* **Multibase Encoding:**  Integrating multibase encoding will enhance interoperability by allowing the SDK to seamlessly communicate with a diverse range of systems and technologies. This will enable broader adoption and integration of Hedera-based decentralized identities.

* **Critical Bug Fixes:** Addressing critical bugs, including issues with message verification, signature validation, and topic subscription management, will ensure the stability and integrity of decentralized applications built on Hedera. This focus on reliability will foster trust in the SDK and the dApps built upon it.

* **Comprehensive Reference Implementation:** The SDK will include an open-source reference implementation, complete with detailed documentation and robust test coverage (targeting 80% across unit, integration, security, and performance tests). This will provide developers with clear guidance, best practices, and confidence in the SDK's quality and reliability.

==== Conclusion

The enhanced Hashgraph DID-SDK represents a significant step forward in decentralized identity management on the Hedera network. By addressing critical challenges in performance, security, and interoperability, the new SDK will provide developers with the tools they need to build innovative, secure, and scalable decentralized applications. This initiative reflects Hederaâ€™s commitment to progress, collaboration, and the advancement of a secure, user-centric, and universally accessible digital identity ecosystem.
