=== Risks and Technical Debt

This section outlines the top architectural risks and technical debt items associated with the Application, along with their potential impact and proposed mitigation strategies.

*1. SDK Dependency and Maintenance*

* **Description:** The application utilizes the Hashgraph DID-SDK. Dependencies on external libraries like this introduce risks related to maintenance, updates, and potential vulnerabilities within the SDK itself.
* **Potential Impact:**  Increased development time, difficulty in resolving issues stemming from the SDK, security vulnerabilities inherited from the SDK.
* **Mitigation Strategy:** Stay informed about SDK updates and security advisories. Establish a process for timely updates and vulnerability patching. Contribute to the SDK's development or consider forking it if necessary to maintain control.

*2. Hedera Network Dependency*

* **Description:** The application is dependent on the Hedera Hashgraph network for core functionality. Any issues with the Hedera network, such as outages, performance degradation, or consensus issues, will directly impact the application.
* **Potential Impact:** Service disruptions, delays in transaction processing, potential data inconsistencies.
* **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for Hedera API calls. Monitor Hedera network status and performance. Consider alternative solutions or fallback mechanisms for critical functionalities in case of Hedera network issues. Explore Hedera mirror nodes for data retrieval.

*3. Scalability and Performance*

* **Description:** As the application grows and user adoption increases, scalability and performance can become bottlenecks.
* **Potential Impact:**  Slow response times, degraded user experience, increased operational costs.
* **Mitigation Strategy:** Design the application with scalability in mind. Employ performance testing and optimization techniques. Utilize caching mechanisms effectively. Monitor application performance and identify potential bottlenecks proactively. Consider horizontal scaling options.

*4. Security of Sensitive Data*

* **Description:** The application handles sensitive user data and private keys. Inadequate security measures could lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.
* **Potential Impact:**  Loss of user data, financial losses, reputational damage.
* **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Enforce strict access controls and authentication mechanisms. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. Stay up-to-date with security best practices and Hedera security recommendations.

==== Best Practices:

* The risks listed above are prioritized based on their potential impact and the likelihood of occurrence.
* This document will be reviewed and updated quarterly or whenever significant changes are made to the application architecture or its dependencies.
* Regular risk assessments will be conducted to identify and address new or evolving risks.
