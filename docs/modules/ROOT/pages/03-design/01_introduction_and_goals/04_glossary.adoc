|Term |Description

|Decentralized Identifier (DID)
|A globally unique identifier that allows entities (like individuals, organizations, or devices) to control their own digital identity without relying on centralized authorities. Think of it as a digital passport for the online world. Example: `did:example:123456789abcdefghi`

|DID Document
|A machine-readable document (often in JSON format) that acts as a verifiable "digital passport" for a DID. It contains essential information about the DID, such as public keys, authentication methods, and service endpoints.

|DID-SDK (Decentralized Identifier Software Development Kit)
|A set of tools and libraries that make it easier for developers to build decentralized applications that use DIDs on the Hedera network. This SDK simplifies the process of creating, managing, and resolving DIDs.

|Client-managed Secret Mode
|A key management approach where the application developer takes full control of managing the cryptographic keys associated with a DID. This offers flexibility but requires careful implementation to ensure security.

|External Secret Mode
|A key management approach where the cryptographic keys are managed outside of the DID-SDK, often by a dedicated key management service or hardware security module. This enhances security by separating key management responsibilities.

|Internal Secret Mode
|A key management approach where the DID-SDK itself manages the cryptographic keys. This can be more convenient for developers but might have security implications depending on the SDK's implementation.

|Interoperability
|The ability of different systems and technologies to communicate and exchange information seamlessly. In the context of DIDs, interoperability ensures that DIDs created on Hedera can be used with other systems and applications.

|Key Management
|The processes and technologies for generating, storing, and managing cryptographic keys. This includes key generation, secure storage, key rotation, and key revocation. Proper key management is crucial for the security of DIDs.

|Multibase Encoding
|A method for encoding binary data (like cryptographic keys) into a textual representation that can be easily shared and used across different systems and protocols. This improves the interoperability of DIDs.

|PrivateKey
|A secret cryptographic key used to generate digital signatures and decrypt messages. In the context of DIDs, private keys are associated with a DID and used to authenticate actions performed on behalf of that DID.

|PublicKey
|A cryptographic key that is mathematically linked to a private key. It is used to verify digital signatures created with the corresponding private key, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
