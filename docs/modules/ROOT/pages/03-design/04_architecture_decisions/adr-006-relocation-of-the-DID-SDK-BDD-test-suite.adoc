=== ADR 006: Relocation of the DID-SDK BDD Test Suite

==== Status

Accepted

==== Date

2025-02-19

==== Context

The DID-SDK BDD test suite, designed for language-agnostic validation of the DID-SDK, is currently non-functional and tightly coupled with the main SDK repository. This coupling hinders independent development, dedicated maintenance, and efficient resource allocation, necessitating a strategic decision on its future.

==== Decision Drivers

* **Independent Development & Release:** Enable separate development and release cycles, decoupled from the main SDK.
* **Focused Resource Allocation:** Allow dedicated resources with specialized BDD and testing expertise.
* **Maintainability & Scalability:** Significantly improve the test suite's maintainability and long-term scalability.
* **Clarity of Purpose:** Establish the test suite as a well-defined, standalone tool.

==== Considered Options

===== **Option 1: Maintain within Current Repository**

* **Description:** Continue maintaining the BDD test suite within the existing DID-SDK repository.
* **Pros:** Code proximity; no new repository setup required.
* **Cons:** Competition for resources; unclear separation of concerns; impedes independent maintenance; tightly coupled CI/CD; necessitates mixed skillsets.

===== **Option 2: Relocate to Separate Repository**

* **Description:** Migrate the BDD test suite to a dedicated, independent repository.
* **Pros:** Enables independent development and release cycles; facilitates dedicated resource allocation; promotes improved maintainability and organization; establishes clear ownership; increases potential for reuse by other projects; allows for an independent, optimized CI/CD pipeline.
* **Cons:** Introduces repository management overhead; requires careful synchronization with SDK changes; necessitates an initial migration effort.

===== **Option 3: Discard the Test Suite**

* **Description:** Abandon the current BDD test suite and explore alternative testing approaches.
* **Pros:** Avoids further investment in the current, flawed implementation; allows exclusive focus on core SDK development.
* **Cons:** Loss of the potential benefits of a language-agnostic BDD test suite; increased risk of regressions without a comprehensive alternative; forfeits the initial investment in the BDD suite.

==== Decision

Relocate the BDD test suite to a separate repository (Option 2).

==== Rationale

* **Strategic Alignment:** Directly supports the original goal of a language-agnostic testing tool by enabling focused, independent development.
* **Enhanced Maintainability:** A separate repository fosters better code organization, reducing complexity and facilitating ongoing maintenance.
* **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Enables the allocation of specialized resources with the necessary BDD and testing expertise.
* **Long-Term Viability:** Establishes a sustainable foundation for the test suite's long-term growth and scalability.
* **Expanded Utility:** Positions the test suite as a standalone tool, potentially usable for testing other components or projects.

==== Follow-Ups

* **Create New Repository:** Establish the new repository with appropriate access controls.
* **Migration Plan:** Develop a detailed plan for migrating code, configurations, and associated resources, minimizing disruption.
* **Documentation:** Prioritize creating comprehensive documentation, including setup, contribution guidelines, and test execution instructions.
* **Roadmap:** Define a clear roadmap for addressing identified weaknesses, implementing improvements, and expanding test coverage.
* **Resource Allocation:** Assign dedicated resources with the required expertise to the new repository.
* **Communication:** Communicate the decision, relocation plan, and rationale to all relevant stakeholders.
* **Review and Adjust:** Review the effectiveness of this ADR and the relocated test suite three months post-implementation.
