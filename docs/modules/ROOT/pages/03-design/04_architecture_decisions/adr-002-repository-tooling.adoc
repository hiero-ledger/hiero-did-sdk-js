=== ADR 002: SDK Repository Tooling

==== Status

Accepted

==== Date

2024-10-24

==== Context

he project is structured as a monorepo, managing multiple libraries for decentralized identity (DID) functionality on the Hedera network. The monorepo includes various packages, such as libraries for cryptographic operations, and DID document management. To effectively manage the monorepo, we need a tool that can handle versioning, package management, building, and testing across multiple JavaScript and TypeScript packages. The decision is to choose the appropriate tooling to support the development and maintenance of this monorepo, with options including Lerna, Nx, Turborepo and Yarn Workspaces.

==== Decision Drivers

1. *Management*: The ability to manage multiple JavaScript/TypeScript packages efficiently within the same repository.
2. *Versioning*: Tools that support automatic versioning and changelog generation across multiple packages.
3. *Performance*: Handling dependencies between packages and optimizing build times.
4. *Testing*: The ability to run independently unit, integration, and end-to-end tests across packages, and to ensure that all necessary dependencies are built and tested correctly.
5. *Developer Experience*: Ease of setup and use for developers working on different packages within the monorepo.
6. *Community Support*: The availability of documentation, community support, and active development for the chosen tooling.
7. *Simplicity*: The tool should be easy to understand and integrate into the existing development workflow.

==== Considered Options

===== Option 1: Lerna

*Description*: Lerna is a popular tool for managing JavaScript monorepos. It simplifies workflows around managing multiple packages in a single repository, supporting independent or locked versioning, dependency hoisting, and linking of local packages.

*Pros*:

* *Well-established*: Lerna has been widely adopted, with strong community support and a rich ecosystem of plugins and extensions.
* *Dependency Hoisting*: Shared dependencies can be hoisted to the root level of the monorepo, minimizing duplication and ensuring consistency across packages.
* *Independent Versioning*: Supports both independent versioning of packages and fixed (locked) versioning for more controlled releases.
* *Automatic Package Linking*: Local packages are automatically linked, which makes cross-package development straightforward without manually managing npm link.
* *Automated Release Workflow*: Lerna provides tools for automated release management, including changelog generation and publishing to npm.

*Cons*:

* *No Built-in Build Optimization*: Lerna focuses primarily on versioning and managing packages. It does not include build caching or task orchestration, which are important for optimizing large monorepos.
* *Scaling Limitations*: As the number of packages grows, Lerna's performance can degrade without additional tools for build performance.
* *Requires Additional Tools*: Lerna doesn't provide advanced task running or build optimization, so additional scripts or tools (e.g., Webpack, Babel) are often needed.

===== Option 2: Nx

*Description*: Nx is a monorepo management tool that focuses on optimizing build performance and developer productivity. It provides features for caching, distributed builds, and dependency-aware task execution, with a built-in support for JavaScript/TypeScript, as well as other languages and technologies.

*Pros*:

* *Advanced Build Caching*: Nx caches the results of previous builds and only rebuilds packages when necessary, leading to significant performance improvements.
* *Dependency Graph Visualization*: Nx automatically generates a dependency graph that shows how different packages interact, helping developers manage dependencies effectively.
* *Task Orchestration*: Nx intelligently runs build, test, and lint tasks in the correct order, based on package dependencies, and only when needed.
* *Language Agnostic*: Nx supports not only JavaScript/TypeScript but also other languages, which is helpful if the monorepo eventually incorporates non-JS packages (e.g., Rust, Go).
* *Scalable for Large Monorepos*: Nx is designed to handle the needs of large monorepos, making it suitable for complex projects with many interdependent packages.

*Cons*:

* *Learning Curve*: Nx has a more complex setup and configuration than simpler tools like Lerna, especially around caching and task orchestration.
* *Overhead*: For smaller projects, Nx's comprehensive features may introduce unnecessary complexity.
* *Complexity*: As the monorepo grows, managing Nx's configuration files and workflows for different environments and tools can become complicated.

===== Option 3: Turborepo

*Description*: Turborepo is a high-performance monorepo build system focused on reducing build times with its built-in caching and task scheduling. It is a more recent tool with a strong emphasis on speed and developer experience.

*Pros*:

* *Fast Build Caching*: Turborepo offers a robust caching system that prevents rebuilding or retesting packages unless absolutely necessary, improving build performance.
* *Minimal Setup*: Turborepo integrates smoothly with existing build systems and requires minimal configuration, making it easy to adopt.
* *Task Orchestration*: Turborepo runs tasks in parallel and in the correct order based on package dependencies, ensuring fast and correct builds and tests.
* *Modern Tooling Integration*: Turborepo works well with other modern JavaScript/TypeScript tools like Webpack, Babel, and TypeScript, providing a good balance of flexibility and performance.

*Cons*:

* *Newer Tool*: As a newer tool, Turborepo does not have the same level of community support and ecosystem maturity as Lerna or Nx.
* *Less Comprehensive Feature Set*: Turborepo is primarily focused on build performance and doesn't offer many project management features (e.g., dependency graphs, testing utilities).
* *Focused on JavaScript/TypeScript*: Turborepo is optimized for JavaScript/TypeScript projects, which could limit its applicability if non-JS packages are added to the monorepo in the future.
* *Lack of Built-in Testing and Linting*: Unlike Nx, Turborepo does not come with built-in support for testing or linting, requiring additional setup for those workflows.

===== Option 4: Yarn Workspaces

*Description*: Yarn Workspaces is a feature provided by Yarn, a popular package manager, to manage multiple packages in a monorepo. It allows you to link packages together and install dependencies in a centralized way.

*Pros*:

* *Built-in Package Linking*: Yarn Workspaces automatically links local packages, making it easy to develop multiple interdependent packages without needing external tools.
* *Simplicity*: Yarn Workspaces is relatively simple to set up and integrates directly with Yarn, requiring no additional tooling beyond a package.json configuration.
* *Centralized Dependency Management*: Dependencies are installed once at the root level and shared among all packages, reducing redundancy and potential version conflicts.
* *Lightweight Solution*: For smaller monorepos, Yarn Workspaces offers an elegant and lightweight approach to managing multiple packages without the overhead of more complex tools like Nx or Lerna.
* *Minimal Configuration*: Yarn Workspaces is configured directly in the package.json file, which simplifies repository management without needing additional configuration files.

*Cons*:

* *No Built-in Task Runner*: Yarn Workspaces only handles package linking and dependency management. It doesn't provide a task runner for building, testing, or linting across packages.
* *No Advanced Build Caching*: Unlike Nx or Turborepo, Yarn Workspaces does not provide advanced build caching or task orchestration, which can lead to longer build times as the monorepo grows.
* *Requires Additional Tooling*: To handle tasks like building, testing, and deployment, additional scripts or tools (e.g., npm/yarn scripts, Webpack) are required.
* *Limited Dependency Management*: Yarn Workspaces lacks advanced features like dependency graph visualization or fine-grained control over package relationships, making it harder to manage complex interdependencies in larger monorepos.

==== Decision

The decision is to use *Lerna* as the primary tooling for managing the Hedera Hashgraph DID SDK monorepo. Reasons for this decision include:

1. *Simplicity and Familiarity*: Lerna is easy to use and has a minimal learning curve, making it a good choice for the team's current needs. It doesn't require complex setup or configuration.
2. *Package Management and Versioning*: Lerna's ability to manage interdependent packages, handle versioning, and automate releases will streamline development and reduce manual overhead.
3. *Community Support*: Lerna is a mature tool with strong community support, ensuring long-term maintainability and stability.
4. *No Overhead for Build Optimization*: Since the current monorepo is small-sized, the lack of build caching or task orchestration in Lerna is not a significant issue at this stage.

==== Follow-Ups

1. *Review and Adjust*: Review this ADR one month post-implementation to compare expectations with actual outcomes.
2. *Document Further ADRs*: Document any additional ADRs arising from this decision, especially for further adjustments or enhancements.
