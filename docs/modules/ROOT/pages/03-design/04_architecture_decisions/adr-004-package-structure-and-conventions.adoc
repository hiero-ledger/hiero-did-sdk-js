=== ADR 004: Package Structure and Conventions

==== Status

Accepted

==== Date

2024-11-01

==== Context

This ADR defines the structure and conventions for individual packages within the Hedera Hashgraph DID SDK monorepo.

==== Decision

Each package within the monorepo will follow this structure:

* `src/`: Contains the TypeScript source code.
* `tests/`: Includes test files (unit, integration, end-to-end).

Each package must include these files:

* `package.json`: Defines package metadata, dependencies, scripts, and configurations.
* `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options.
* `jest.config.ts`: Configures Jest for testing and code coverage.
* `README.md`: Provides package information.

==== Consequences

* **Increased Developer Productivity:**  A well-defined structure simplifies navigation.
* **Better Code Reusability:**  Separating concerns into packages promotes code reusability.
* **Simplified Testing:**  A consistent structure facilitates writing and organizing tests.
