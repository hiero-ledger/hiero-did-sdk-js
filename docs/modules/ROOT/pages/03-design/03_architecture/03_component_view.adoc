* **Hedera Topic Service:** A service on the Hedera network that enables publish/subscribe communication.

* **Hedera Node:** A node in the Hedera network that acts as a gateway for submitting transactions.

==== Interactions

* **dApp Developers use Registrar and Resolver:** Developers interact with these components to manage and resolve DIDs.

* **Registrar uses Signer and Publisher:** The Registrar utilizes the Signer for signing DID-related operations and the Publisher for submitting transactions to the Hedera network.

* **Publisher publishes signed transactions to Hedera Topic Service:** The Publisher component sends signed transactions to the Hedera Topic Service for processing.

* **Resolver retrieves DID Documents from Hedera Topic Service:** The Resolver component retrieves DID Documents from the Hedera Topic Service.

* **Hedera Topic Service communicates with Hedera Node:**  The Hedera Topic Service interacts with the Hedera Node to publish and retrieve messages.
