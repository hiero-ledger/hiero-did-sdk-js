=== Runtime View

This diagram illustrates the runtime interactions between the components of the Hashgraph DID-SDK, a dApp developer, and the Hedera network during a typical DID management workflow. It shows the sequence of operations and how data flows between the components.

==== Components

* **dApp Developer:**  The developer interacts with the DID-SDK to manage DIDs.

* **Hashgraph DID-SDK:**  Contains the components responsible for DID operations:

    * **Registrar:**  Handles DID creation, updates, deactivation, and resolution.
    * **Resolver:** Resolves DID Documents.
    * **Signer:** Signs DID messages.
    * **Publisher:** Signs and publishes transactions.

* **Hedera Topic Service:**  Provides a publish/subscribe mechanism for DID communication.

* **Hedera Node:**  Acts as a gateway to the Hedera network.

==== Interactions (Runtime Workflow)

1. **DID Management:** The dApp developer initiates DID management operations (create, update, deactivate) through the Registrar component.

2. **Signature Request:** The Registrar requests the Signer to sign the DID message.

3. **DID Document Publication:** The Registrar sends the DID Document to the Publisher for publication.

4. **Transaction Publication:** The Publisher signs the transaction and publishes it to the Hedera Topic Service.

5. **Communication with Hedera Network:** The Hedera Topic Service interacts with the Hedera Node to process the transaction.

6. **DID Document Resolution:** The dApp developer requests the Resolver to resolve a DID Document.

7. **DID Document Retrieval:** The Resolver retrieves the DID Document from the Hedera Topic Service.
