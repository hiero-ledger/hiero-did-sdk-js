==== People

* dApp Developer (Person): Builds applications that need DID operations (create, update, deactivate, resolve) and Verifiable Credentials/AnonCreds integrations.
* Operator/DevOps (Person): Configures network access, credentials, and optional external KMS (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).

==== Software Systems

* Hiero DID SDK JS (System): Monorepo of npm packages that expose APIs to manage and resolve DIDs on Hedera, plus utilities for cryptography, caching, compression, messaging, and AnonCreds registry integration.
* Hedera Network (External System): Provides Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) topics, Nodes for submitting transactions, and Mirror Nodes for reading messages.
* HashiCorp Vault (External System, optional): External KMS used by optional signer/verifier packages for key custody.

==== Relationships

* dApp Developer -> Hiero DID SDK JS: Calls Registrar to perform DID operations; calls Resolver to resolve DID Documents; may call AnonCreds registry APIs.
* Hiero DID SDK JS -> Hedera Network: Publishes DID operations to HCS topics via Hedera Clients; reads topic messages via Mirror Node APIs.
* Hiero DID SDK JS -> HashiCorp Vault (optional): Uses Vault-backed signer/verifier packages for signing and verification without exposing private keys.
