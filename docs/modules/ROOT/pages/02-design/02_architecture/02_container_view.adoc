==== Components

* **dApp Developer:** Represents developers who build applications utilizing the Hiero DID SDK.

* **Hiero DID SDK:**  The software development kit containing the Core Module.

    * **Core Module:**  Provides the core functionalities for managing DIDs, including creating, updating, and deactivating DIDs, signing and verifying DID messages, and handling transaction signing and execution.

* **Hedera Consensus Service:** A service on the Hedera network that enables publish/subscribe communication. The DID SDK uses this service for DID-related communication.

* **Hedera Node:** A node in the Hedera network that acts as a gateway for submitting transactions and interacting with the network.

==== Interactions

* **dApp Developers use the Core Module:** Developers interact with the Core Module to perform DID operations and integrate DID functionalities into their applications.

* **Core Module uses the Hedera Topic Service:** The Core Module utilizes the Hedera Topic Service for communication related to DID management.

* **Hedera Topic Service communicates with Hedera Node:** The Hedera Topic Service interacts with the Hedera Node to publish and retrieve messages, ensuring that DID-related communication is handled efficiently and reliably.
