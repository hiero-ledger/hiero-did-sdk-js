=== ADR 005: SDK Packages and External Dependencies

==== Status

Accepted

==== Date

2024-11-01

==== Context

This ADR provides an overview of the core packages within the Hiero DID SDK and outlines the key external dependencies required by the SDK.

==== Decision

The Hiero DID SDK will be composed of the following core packages:

* `core`: Provides interfaces and utilities for other SDK packages. It's a required dependency for all other packages.
* `registrar`: Implements the DID registration process and operations like updating and deactivating DIDs on the Hedera network.
* `resolver`: Allows resolving DID documents from the Hedera network and verifying their integrity.
* `signer-internal`: Implements an internal signer that uses a local key pair (Hedera Private Key Class) to sign messages.
* `publisher-internal`: Implements an internal publisher (using Hedera Client) that publishes Hedera transactions to the network.
* `messages`: Defines the message formats for Hedera DID messages and lifecycle events for them and lifecycle manager.


The SDK will utilize the following external dependencies:

* `@hashgraph/sdk`: The official Hedera SDK for interacting with the Hedera network, sending transactions, and querying state.


==== Consequences

* **Modularity and Reusability:** Separating functionality into distinct packages promotes modularity and allows for easier reuse of components within the SDK and potentially in other projects.
* **Maintainability:**  A clear division of responsibilities across packages simplifies maintenance and updates.
* **Flexibility:**  The modular design allows developers to select and use only the packages necessary for their specific needs.
* **Extensibility:**  The package structure enables easier extension of existing functionality and the addition of new features.
