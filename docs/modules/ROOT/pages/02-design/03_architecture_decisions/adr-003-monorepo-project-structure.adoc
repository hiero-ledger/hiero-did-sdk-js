=== ADR 003: Monorepo Project Structure

==== Status

Accepted

==== Date

2024-11-01

==== Context

This ADR defines the high-level project structure for the Hiero DID SDK monorepo. A well-defined structure is crucial for maintainability and scalability as the project grows.

==== Decision

The monorepo will be organized into the following top-level directories:

* `packages/`: Contains individual packages for different parts of the SDK (e.g., core DID library, signers, utilities).
* `examples/`: Includes sample applications and code snippets demonstrating SDK usage.
* `docs/`: Contains documentation files, guides, and API references.
* `scripts/`: Includes scripts for common tasks (building, testing, linting, releasing).
* `test-suites/`: Contains test files and configurations for BDD tests.

==== Consequences

* **Improved Maintainability:** A clear structure makes it easier to maintain the codebase.
* **Enhanced Scalability:**  Allows for adding new packages without increasing complexity.
