= @hashgraph-did-js-sdk/signer-internal

This package provides an internal signer implementation for the Hashgraph DID SDK. This signer manages keys within the application's memory, making it suitable for:

*   Development and testing environments
*   Applications where security requirements are less stringent

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
npm install @hashgraph-did-js-sdk/signer-internal
----

== Usage

This example demonstrates how to generate a new key pair, or import an existing key:

[source,typescript]
----
import { InternalSigner } from '@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/signer-internal';

const signer = new InternalSigner(); // Generates a new key pair

// Or, import an existing key:
const signerWithKey = new InternalSigner("0x..."); // Provide your private key in hexadecimal format

const publicKey = await signer.getPublicKey(); 
const signature = await signer.sign(message);
const isValid = await signer.verify(message, signature);
----

== API Reference

=== `InternalSigner` Class

==== `constructor(privateKeyHex?: string)`

Creates a new `InternalSigner` instance.

*   `privateKeyHex` _(optional)_ -  A hexadecimal string representation of a private key to import. If not provided, a new key pair will be generated.

==== `getPublicKey(): Promise<string>`

Asynchronously retrieves the public key associated with the signer, encoded in Base58 format.

*   **Returns:**  `Promise<string>` - A promise that resolves to the public key.

==== `sign(message: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array>`

Asynchronously signs the provided message using the signer's private key.

*   `message`: The message to sign as a `Uint8Array`.
*   **Returns:**  `Promise<Uint8Array>` - A promise that resolves to the signature.

==== `verify(message: Uint8Array, signature: Uint8Array): Promise<boolean>`

Asynchronously verifies the given signature against the provided message using the signer's public key.

*   `message`: The message to verify as a `Uint8Array`.
*   `signature`: The signature to verify as a `Uint8Array`.
*   **Returns:**  `Promise<boolean>` - A promise that resolves to `true` if the signature is valid, `false` otherwise.
