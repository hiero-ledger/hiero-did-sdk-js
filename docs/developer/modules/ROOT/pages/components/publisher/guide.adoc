= Publisher

== Introduction

The `Publisher` is a core component within the Hashgraph DID SDK. It streamlines interactions with the distributed ledger by providing a standardized way to submit, execute, and pay for transactions. This ensures that DID-related operations are reliably processed and recorded on the network. The `Publisher` interface promotes interoperability and simplifies the development of DID applications, abstracting away the complexities of direct ledger interactions.

== Implementations

The Hashgraph DID SDK offers various publisher implementations to cater to diverse needs and preferences. These implementations are packaged separately to allow for modularity and flexibility in DID applications.

For instance, the `@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/publisher-internal` package provides an internal publisher that directly interacts with the Hedera network. This is suitable for applications seeking a simplified way to execute transactions. Refer to the xref:packages/publisher-internal/guide.adoc[`@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/publisher-internal`] package documentation for more details.

== Interface

The `Publisher` interface enables developers to seamlessly integrate transaction handling logic within their DID applications, regardless of the underlying distributed ledger technology.

This interface defines the core methods for interacting with the network and publishing transactions:

*  `network(): string`:  Returns the name or identifier of the network that the publisher is connected to.
*  `publicKey(): Promise<MultibasePublicKey>`: Asynchronously retrieves the public key associated with the publisher.
*  `publish(transaction): Promise<any>`: Asynchronously submits the provided transaction to the network, executes it, and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a result object containing the outcome of the transaction (e.g., success/failure status, transaction ID, etc.).

Developers are encouraged to create and contribute their own publisher implementations, adhering to the `Publisher` interface, to extend the SDK's capabilities and support a broader range of distributed ledger technologies and custom transaction handling logic.
