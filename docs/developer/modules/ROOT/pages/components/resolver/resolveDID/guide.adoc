= `resolveDID` Function

== Introduction

The `resolveDID` function is a core component of the Hashgraph DID SDK. It retrieves and verifies DID Documents associated with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) registered using the Hedera DID method. This ensures you have the latest, cryptographically-verified information about a DID.

== Resolving a DID Document

This example demonstrates how to resolve a DID and retrieve its corresponding DID Document:

[source, typescript]
----
import { resolveDID } from "@hashgraph-did-js-sdk/resolver";

const did = "did:hedera:testnet:z6Mkhj..."; // Replace with the DID you want to resolve

const didDocument = await resolveDID(did);

console.log(didDocument); 
----

The `resolveDID` function handles the retrieval and cryptographic verification of the DID Document, ensuring its authenticity and integrity. This provides a reliable way to access and utilize DID information for various applications and interactions.
