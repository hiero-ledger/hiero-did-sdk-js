= `createDID` Acceptance Tests

This document outlines the various scenarios for creating DID documents using the `createDID` function in the SDK.

== Background

All scenarios assume an SDK Client instance is set with:

* Operator private key: `302e020100300506032b65700422042091132178e72057a1d7528025956fe39b0b847f200ab59b2fdd367017f3087137`
* Account ID: `0.0.2`
* Network: `localnode`
